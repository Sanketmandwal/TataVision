I am planning to buy my first car and have test-driven the following options within a budget of around 20 lakhs. I would appreciate some expert advice on which one to choose:\n\nXUV700 Petrol AX5: I personally like this car, but I'm concerned about its fuel consumption. Various forums mention that it gives about 6-8 kmpl in the city and 10-12 kmpl on highways. Can any current owners validate these numbers?\n\nVirtus 1.0 Topline: I am leaning towards this car since the 1.0 TSI is a turbocharged engine that reportedly offers 12-14 kmpl in the city and 18-21 kmpl on the highway after a run of 3,000 km. Virtus owners, can you confirm these figures?\n\nInitially, I considered the Virtus 1.5 GT, but I read on several forums that the DSG transmission isn't as reliable as a torque converter, so I decided against it.\n\nMy requirements are:\n\nDaily office commute within Noida (40 km round trip)\nGood after-sales service in the NCR region\nLow maintenance costs\nHigh safety standards\nModerate off-roading capabilities for trips to places like Shimla, Kufri, Manali, and Leh\nA reliable car (both VW and Mahindra are known for reliability)\nGiven these criteria, which car should I choose?

Idk how to frame this or to post this i am just writing it, I'll cut the emotions and keep it rational, so I 18M have found myself along with my family of 4 in a very unfortunate situation, well soon to be 3 as docs losing hopes for my father. We are based in Pimpri-Chinchwad,  So at the dawn of last year my father[46] was diagnosed with Blood Cancer, specifically AML in Deenanath Mangeshkar Hospital. He was cancer-free after a few months as it was detected very early. We got his Bone Marrow Transplant [BMT] done, and his brother's match of bone marrow was only 70%, so to get that to 100% we had to do a procedure that was well over 25L. Post BMT he was getting back to normal even to his 9to5 job which he lived for. But again a few months back we saw a spike in WBCs and it was a mutation in AML, now last to last week we tried to give him a very high dose of chemo (FLAG and CLAG) which literally kills every possible thing, the doc also told us this could lead in a very bad as he also has a history of cardiac disease with 1 angioplasty done but we had literally no other option left everything was tried, everything. So one day into it, we landed in ICU terminating the chemotherapy of 5 days, getting diagnosed with pneumonia and infrants in the brain. \n\nHe is a financially sound man and had savings of around 50L. He has a good-paying job of ~50L PA. Which was brought down ~35L last year after his treatment was going on, he was still working and attending phone calls even after there was no need to, that's how much passion he has.\n\nWe have a home loan of idk how many years left but emi being ~25k, a 1700sqft in Pimpri-Chinchwad. A car loan, EMI of ~50k which was being paid by his company but he owns it, idk how he did but did that, the car is an XUV700 AXL. We fully own a Ciaz zxi driven 1.4L km. \n\nAbout his term insurance he has a 1.5Cr cover, idk if there are any savings left, he had ~20L invested in MF, me and my brothers'(M15) education policy of ~25L combined. We sold our paternal grandparent's house earlier this month(they passed away around 2018 both of them) which brought ~12L named after my father.\n\nMy father has two brothers both well-off based in Pune. My mother has two brothers both well-off based in Pimpri-Chinchwad. My maternal grandparents are well-off based in Dehu Road earlier in Kothrud.\n\nI am keeping my hopes high but also being prepared for the worst.

Even though I don’t need a 7-seater *right now*, it feels like a better value-for-money option for occasional group trips or emergencies.\n* **Boot Space**:\n   * Harrier already has good boot space for a 5-seater.\n   * Safari could offer similar practicality by folding down the rear seats when the 7-seater isn’t needed.\n\n# Concerns:\n\n1. **Looks**: I find the Harrier more appealing than the Safari. Does anyone else agree, or am I overthinking?\n2. **Utility**: None of my friends own a 7-seater, so having one could make me “that guy” everyone calls for group outings. Still, how often would I really need that extra seating?\n3. **Same Engine**: Both cars share the same engine, mileage, pickup, and comfort, so there’s no mechanical advantage to choosing one over the other.\n\n# TL;DR:\n\nAm I being irrational for leaning towards the Harrier just because of its looks, even though the Safari offers more versatility for just ₹50,000 extra?

Funny enough, this is the exact spec that I was thinking of buying the new one (silver AWD AX7L AT) and I am really tempted to check it out. The asking price is 17.5lakhs though it's negotiable.\n\n2. 2022 AX7L Petrol AT\n\nThis has run 22k kms and looks to be in even better condition than the above one. I am okay it being a petrol. The only reason I was going to go with the Diesel (if I buy a new one) was AWD. I am actually more inclined towards the petrol. Asking price is 16.5lakhs and it's also negotiable. Given that the price is quite good, I am willing to overlook the fact that this would be a FWD.\n\nI am planning to check these 2 out tomorrow and if things go well will probably also get it checked by a mechanic (open to suggestions, I am in Guwahati).\n\nLet me know what you guys think and any potential things that I should be in the lookout for.

When we say encroachment, most people think of poor shanties (and rich bungalows) on lake beds. But there is a far more dangerous encroachment on that's going unpunished. It is the rich who are encroaching our roads with parking.\n\nIn the last few months, the number of people deciding that they have a right to park on the road outside their homes has increased dramatically. Look at areas in Indiranagar, New Tippasandra and Koramangala, and you'll see that most roads have become single file because people park outside their homes. Are their vehicles blocking traffic or causing inconvenience? Who cares? So what if the other half of the road is dug up? People will still park outside their homes and not shift an inch!\n\nI'm not even talking about valet parking in these areas for customers. These are cars that have been parked because there is no parking inside the premises. It's become such a menace that in some areas, we see two lines of vehicles parked on either side. I doubt even ambulances or fire engines can cross some of these roads.\n\nThere should be a special heavy penalty on people parking huge vehicles like Tata Safari, Fortuners, XUV700, Thar, Volvo and Innovas around corners. You can hardly see incoming traffic in turns. If you can spend so much money buying a car, you better have parking inside your premises. \n\nPeople will quickly make an argument about them paying taxes and having a right to this. I pay taxes as well, but I park inside my building within my alloted parking spots. I ask visitors to park in areas where they don't inconvenience others. \n\nEven worse is that after the ruckus around towing in no parking areas, the rich have been emboldened to park anywhere, and pick up quarrels with anyone who questions them. Bangalore Traffic Police seems too stretched to do anything about this. And our political leaders have grand visions about building tunnel roads and flyovers, while letting this go unpunished.\n\nIn a year or so, I foresee that we will all be crawling on all roads because of unpunished parking. Unless these guys are fined now, and heavily, this will just grow.

Idk how to frame this or to post this i am just writing it, I'll cut the emotions and keep it rational, so I 18M have found myself along with my family of 4 in a very unfortunate situation, well soon to be 3 as docs losing hopes for my father. We are based in Pimpri-Chinchwad,  So at the dawn of last year my father[46] was diagnosed with Blood Cancer, specifically AML in Deenanath Mangeshkar Hospital. He was cancer-free after a few months as it was detected very early. We got his Bone Marrow Transplant [BMT] done, and his brother's match of bone marrow was only 70%, so to get that to 100% we had to do a procedure that was well over 25L. Post BMT he was getting back to normal even to his 9to5 job which he lived for. But again a few months back we saw a spike in WBCs and it was a mutation in AML, now last to last week we tried to give him a very high dose of chemo (FLAG and CLAG) which literally kills every possible thing, the doc also told us this could lead in a very bad as he also has a history of cardiac disease with 1 angioplasty done but we had literally no other option left everything was tried, everything. So one day into it, we landed in ICU terminating the chemotherapy of 5 days, getting diagnosed with pneumonia and infrants in the brain. \n\nHe is a financially sound man and had savings of around 50L. He has a good-paying job of ~50L PA. Which was brought down ~35L last year after his treatment was going on, he was still working and attending phone calls even after there was no need to, that's how much passion he has.\n\nWe have a home loan of idk how many years left but emi being ~25k, a 1700sqft in Pimpri-Chinchwad. A car loan, EMI of ~50k which was being paid by his company but he owns it, idk how he did but did that, the car is an XUV700 AXL. We fully own a Ciaz zxi driven 1.4L km. \n\nAbout his term insurance he has a 1.5Cr cover, idk if there are any savings left, he had ~20L invested in MF, me and my brothers'(M15) education policy of ~25L combined. We sold our paternal grandparent's house earlier this month(they passed away around 2018 both of them) which brought ~12L named after my father.\n\nMy father has two brothers both well-off based in Pune. My mother has two brothers both well-off based in Pimpri-Chinchwad. My maternal grandparents are well-off based in Dehu Road earlier in Kothrud.\n\nI am keeping my hopes high but also being prepared for the worst.

Hi Drivers,\n\nI am going to buy Hyundai Creta (new model - facelift), SXE (Executive) (SX is using infotainment with bluelink and due to shortage in supply, waiting time is >6m, for SXE without head unit \\[i.e. infotainment\\], the waiting time is \\~1m). The overall budget is 50K-70K for all the modifications.\n\n# Infotainment [15K-30K]\n\nThe car comes with Arkamys speakers (I will look into it to upgrade/change), but I am open to choosing the infotainment head unit (Android based)\n\nSo, I am looking for options regarding that (budget is flexible 15k-30k, can go higher if the product is good).\n\nSome of my considerations:\n\n* [amazon.in/Sony-XAV-AX3000-Receiver-Android-Apple/dp/B07GTPN2MD/](https://amazon.in/Sony-XAV-AX3000-Receiver-Android-Apple/dp/B07GTPN2MD)\n\nSome of the requirements are:\n\n* **MUST:** 10-inch display (to fit in Hyundai dash) (I can go bigger 11'-12', it will sit on top like tesla)\n* **MUST:** Good specs (good ram 4GB-6GB and storage 32GB-64GB to prevent system freeze)\n* **MUST:** Integrations with the car (rearview camera, sunroof control, mic, voice control button)\n* **MUST:** Android Auto and Apple car play (apple car play is optional if I can connect my iPhone with the head unit)\n* **GOOD TO HAVE:** Physical buttons to navigate the menu (and volume nob)\n* **GOOD TO HAVE:** Wireless Android Auto (Some 2021 models support wireless android auto, older models only support via USB connection)\n* Good inbuild sound-card (for better audio experience)\n* Integration with GPS tracker (I will buy an external GPS tracker if needed, but if the head unit can interface with the tracker, and I can configure it using the infotainment, its best)\n\n# Speakers\n\nIt comes with default Arkamys speakers (4-speakers). \\[I am a music fan and personally have Harman Kardon and JBL at my home\\].\n\n* Can I add more speakers and subwoofer with the existing setup (to get an 8.1 setup) or can I replace the audio system completely).\n* Also please recommend some brands JBL, Bose, etc. I will prefer better and clear audio quality over heavy bass and loud sound.\n\nI am looking to add at least 1 subwoofer to the existing setup.\n\n# GPS\n\nI want to track my vehicle, must-have requirements are:\n\n* Live car tracking\n* Geo-fencing alerts\n* Speed alerts\n\nGood to have requirements:\n\n* Remote engine start or stop\n* Accident and crash alerts\n* Integration with the infotainment/head unit\n* Discrete installation (to make it hard for thieves to find and disable it)\n* Without an OBD interface (so that I can use OBD for other devices later)\n* OBD interface is fine if the device is really good or can provide me additional details like engine health, mileage etc\n* Free / cheap plan after the bundled offer is finished.\n* Theft alert\n\n# Miscellaneous Accessories\n\nFor all the accessories my requirement is that they should look good after installation, and should not look like a poking pimple inside my car, and preferable if they can connect with the internal wiring of the car (it is not a must-have) (I don't want my 12V outlet to be blocked with these accessories)\n\n* Dashcam\n   * Seamless installation with car Dashboard (I want the thing to be installed without poking out and wires going everywhere)\n   * Small package, so that I can put it on car windscreen defogger\n   * Easy connectivity with laptop or mobile\n* Tire pressure monitoring system (TPMS)\n   * Internal TPMS and external TPMS pressure sensors\n   * Small display that I can put in front of my odometer\n   * Best if it can somehow integrate the system and display the info in the Hyundai Creta 4\" info screen that is present in the odometer area.\n* DC12V to AC220V converter\n   * Best if I can connect it directly to the battery (and keep my 12v free), although it is not a must-have requirement.\n   * Power output 180w\n   * Comes with a fuse or internal circuitry to prevent drawing over the limit of power from the battery.\n* Air Purifier\n   * Small and compact, beautiful looking\n   * Best if it can integrate with the car AC system and is not occupying the space inside the car cabin.\n* Safety and emergency accessories\n   * Puncture repair kit, tire inflator, reflective alert triangle, etc.\n* Any other accessories that you think will be helpful.", "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "emojis": [], "location": {"profile_location": null,

Hi all. So my Hyundai Creta which was bought in June 2021 (30k kms) was due service and had very low engine oil as well. Upon checking the issue, the service centre reported that the compression is very low and engine needs to be opened to identify the problem. Once they opened the engine, they found out that the piston rings had been burnt completely and there were scratches inside the piston cylinders as well. The reason for this was identified as a manufacturing problem due to which the turbo charger was not functioning properly and caused the piston to behave abnormally. I’m not an expert with the technicalities so this is the gist of what I could grasp. \n\nNow they have agreed to send the engine to the manufacturing plant and get it “repaired” by boring and they will also replace all child parts. All this will be done for free under warranty and the service centre claims this is as per the warranty policy but I believe I should be entitled to replacement of the entire engine considering it is a manufacturing defect or at least restart my warranty period. \n\nPeople of Reddit, please help me understand what can I demand from them and what can I get as compensation since this shouldn’t be happening within 2 years and 30k kms.", "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "emojis": [], "location": {"profile_location": null, "geo_location": null, "nlp_location": null, "final_location": null, "tier": null, "country": "India", "state": null, "city": null}, "sentiment": {"label": "negative", "score": -0.57}, "keywords": ["hyundai", "creta", "engine", "manufacturing", "defect", "what"], "aspects": [{"aspect": "performance", "sentiment": "negative", "score": -0.57}, {"aspect": "service", "sentiment": "negative", "score": -0.57}], "intent": "query", "embedding": null, "embedding_model": null, "processed_at": "2025-10-03T17:36:37.353773Z", "source_id": "reddit:0e0a36e312d6", "target_vehicle": "Hyundai Creta", "vehicle_category": "Compact SUV"}

So it's been a year, aye? The guilt and weight on my shoulder will forever remain stuck with me as long as I may breath. The circumstances in which we lost you, and the role I could have played, to save you, the end result might have been different & you may still be there with us, and I still remember both of us talking in our morse code whistles as soon as we used to step out of our door. Since we had adajcent houses. Tears are rolling down my eyes as I type this now,but it's time to get these things off my chest. They say the void that you left will take time to heal, but certain voids aren't meant to be filled. I remember the day when you brought a game for my new computer and as soon as you arrived there it was a view that we cherrised for the rest of our lives. \"Dono bhai bhen murge bane hue tha darwaze ke bahr. Aur bhai upar railing se latak ke dekh rha ki kuch bolon ya kat loon ab\". I remember when I came back from Chandigarh after leaving my job, and having lunch in his house the next day. I was seating on the dinning table, lost in own world despite eating my usual best meal of my life, tai ke hath ke lip smacking, daal chawal and kadi. Bhai, shop se aya dekha bola, shukar hai yra agya tu, tere bina ghr khali khali se lagta tha. I just hmmed, I was stressed about my future and didn't paid much attention what I was eating. He quietly went to the kitchen, and came with a plate full of onions for me, and said aise kaisa ho gya abu pyaz ke khana kha rha and left for shop again. There was something else about that person, he had a charm an essence of selflessness like no other.All it would take was just a few meetings and conversation of you with him, and he would happily turn the world and stride, upside down for you. Despite you being a total stranger to him. He was one of a kind, gem. Those who know him would agree. Some of his favourite quotes:\n1) Chak janaga, dekha janga (Just sleep, when it's time to sleep and fuck everything else)\n2) Oy meriye dasse kithi janwa fassse (When you stuck in some deep shit)\n3) Baal bade sardar de, paer bade gawar de (He loved saying it to me)\n\nI traveled most of the Himachal with him, in his creta. To me despite being an avid photography enthusiast and travell lover it was heavenly. But with him it wasn't just about the destination, it was all about the journey and his company that used to bring a smile to my face, and a peace to my heart. Bhai, sath hai fir kya scene hai, dekhi jayegi! I enjoyed that some company equally well even when he would just swing by cave room and do nothing. That's the thing when you love someone unconditionally, it doesn't matter what you guys are doing together, as long as you are together. His love for me was unconditional and in the purest of forms.Maybe I couldn't let him know what he meant, to me when he was alive. Not many people had the balls and courage to walk into his man cave of a room at 4/30 in the morning and scream at him \" Bhai raat ko barca match har gyi hai, soya ni hoon aur neend aa ni rhi chal morning walk krne chlana hum dono ne \".

No email or phone communication so far to notify me of this.\n\n4. Delivery executive is super rude - refuses to help, refuses to connect us to customer care, pretty much just stands still for 30 mins.\n\n5. After some screaming and shouting, **I call the cops**. When they arrive, he shits his pants and starts cooperating, and allows us to speak to his superiors.\n\n6. Revv has no other car to give us (no replacement, and no second car either when I suggest they give me 2 so that I can take my luggage).\n\n7. I had to let go of some luggage and finally accepted the car and rode away.\n\nI've also recorded a video of the delivery exec which I plan to send to Revv when I escalate.\n\nNow, what are my options?\n\nI do plan to email them and also issue a chargeback on my credit card for this.

Got Fastag for our VW Polo when it was introduced first. Later we got a Creta and started using that for long trips and malls. Due to this, Polo's Fastag remained dormant for around 2 yrs (not including COVID yr). Then, when we went to a mall that had Fastag parking payment system, payment failed. That is when I found out it had been blacklisted and the wallet linked to it was blocked.\n\nWhen we contacted their customer care(CC, 400 dedicated line for Airtel Payments Bank), they cited the reason that since both wallet and Fastag were dormant for >1yr, it was automatically blocked by their system. They asked us to send 3 documents: a letter requesting reactivation of wallet and unblocking of Fastag, and self attested copies of Aadhar and DL. We sent all three over mail and received confirmation mail stating case registered with case number. It also stated that they will send an update mail in 3 days. We waited 1 week to no mail. So called them back and they say that they are unable to open and view the documents (sent as pdf). So we resent them as jpg files over mail and also registered a case through the app. Received their same mail with case no. and asking to wait 3 days for update. No update again. You can see a pattern here.\n\nWe called them again after a week and they said that they are working on it. No mail again. Called again (I'm the one having to spend time calling them every week) and they said biometrics are expired and had to reauthenticate through their \"Banking Point\". First visited Airtel office near us, they said they don't do Banking. Was redirected to other points on their app. Called every single one near us and none of them had either the finger print machine or understood what we were saying. Spent more than 6 hrs just that day for this. Fed up, called them again and this time asked to be escalated to higher authority. They said biometrics wasn't needed. This enraged us. This person said that documents were enough and he will personally see that the case would be resolved. Again got a mail with new case number on 26/8/24.\n\nThis time, my mom, whose name and phone number was on car RC and Fastag, had to travel abroad. She gave me her mail login to follow up on this and left. There was no mail again. Had to wait 12 days for her to return. Once she returned, called them again (yesterday, 14/09/2024) and asked to be escalated as the tier 1 CC was incompetent to say the least and seemed to only be reading of a script. Tier 2 CC was better as they had better knowledge on the topic. This time, they said that there is a mismatch between documents given during registration(\\~2015) and docs given now. When asked what the mismatch was, he had no idea and kept repeating that it was a mismatch. After some back and forth, he said there is mismatch in DL. Then again, he said he did not know where the mismatch was. Tried to make him understand that DL was renewed 5 yrs ago(2019) and DL number was same, to no avail. He asked us to go to RTO and get DL renewal confirmation slip (does it even exist??), but we said \"No, we can't go to RTO and get some unknown slip by spending time on a weekday. You know about the state of RTOs in our city.\" He said that it was bank policy to get the slip and he can't do anything without it. We did not budge. Told him to send the policy over mail. He gave excuses saying that it can only be sent by \"mail dept\" and he had no power to. He said we can send a mail asking for policy.\n\nWe then asked him why we weren't updated about these issues over mail when it arose. He said that mail was sent, but we didn't get any. Asked him the date when it was sent, and he said 21/8/24. This led to a kind of quarrel with us telling that the case was raised only on 26/8 after talking to one of your employees and how are you telling us this issue rose on 21/8. We didn't want to deal with him as he too did not understand us. Asked him to escalate higher to tier 3 CC.\n\nThis was the floor manager. He was able to understand the issue and said that he can work with the existing license given that we provide him with a letter stating that the license was renewed. I sent this yesterday night and now waiting for \"update\". But this time he provided us with his name. He asked us to tell his name and we will be redirected to him directly.\n\nThis goes to show how bad their system is. With no physical bank, there is no one to be questioned directly. If there had been a physical bank, the problem could have been solved long time ago. Making everything digital is not the solution. The best would be a hybrid system. Planning to move to Consumer Court if this also does not work out.\n\nYou might ask why not move to a different provider. I simply can't as VIN is linked to Airtel and other banks cannot register the VIN in their system.\n\nIf you made it this far props to you for reading.\n\ntl;dr: Airtel blocked wallet and Fastag. Unbearable back and forth with customer care call center for more than a month to no avail. Looking at consumer court as option if it doesn't work out.

I am writing this because a recent discussion on TeamBhp about this topic was frightening. Kia Seltos and Hyundai Creta are two very popular cars and have brake failure issues that cannot be solved by service stations as per the owners.\n\n\n\nhttps://www.team-bhp.com/forum/indian-car-scene/228399-brake-failure-issues-kia-seltos.html\n\n\"This guy was driving in cruise set at 60 kmph. On seeing an upcoming red traffic signal, he started to slow down and pressed the clutch pedal to downshift and the cruise got disengaged. Upon pressing the brake pedal , there was absolutely no braking available. He said the pedal felt like a hard wood with no movement or play. He tried slamming it again and again but to no avail - this must have happened for 7-8 seconds. He panicked and was fast approaching the signal. He stayed in 6 th gear itself and managed to pull the hand brake and stopped the car in the nick of time and inches before a two wheeler guy who was with his family with the pillion lady holding a baby in hand. He luckily managed to avert the mishap. The car apparently stalled with assistance from hand brake. He says the rear wheels got locked when it came to a stop. He started the car again, moved slowly and pulled over after the signal and the brake was then found to be operating normally afterwards.\"\n\nBasically, the pedal becomes hard suddenly and you can miss braking. Some are saying that it is related to a fault in the vacuum system so there is no brake assist to help you multiply the force, and the pedal becomes like a piece of wood. Others are saying it is related to malfunction of ABS which leads to the pedal becoming hard and unresponsive.\n\nBottom line is that if you, or your relative own these cars, be very careful if you travel in them and tell your relatives to be mindful of this problem, and not expect flawless braking.\n\nTLDR: Creta and Seltos are popular cars with brake failure issues. Please be very cautious about traveling in them or buying them.", "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "emojis": [], "location": {"profile_location": null, "geo_location": null, "nlp_location": null, "final_location": null, "tier": null, "country": "India", "state": null, "city": null}, "sentiment": {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.0}, "keywords": ["kia", "seltos", "hyundai", "creta", "owners", "beware"], "aspects": [{"aspect": "safety", "sentiment": "neutral", "score": 0.0}, {"aspect": "service", "sentiment": "neutral", "score": 0.0}], "intent": "query", "embedding": null, "embedding_model": null, "processed_at": "2025-10-03T17:36:37.363763Z", "source_id": "reddit:7a2c4c74f594", "target_vehicle": "Hyundai Creta", "vehicle_category": "Compact SUV"}

Not interested in second hand car and diesel cars.\n\n2. Budget is around 10L\n\n3. Took test drive of Hyundai Venue iMT(Clutchless Engine but with manual gears) and really liked it as it has turbo engine. Despite showroom person riding it at 120Kmph the test drive was very smooth. My only concern is I have watched people saying on YouTube that Venue lags when rotations per minute is less than 2k. What's your opinion about this?\n\n4. I am not preferring Kia Sonet even though it has more features than Hyundai Venue because Kia has lesser service centers in Karnataka and specifically it's not there in my hometown.\n\n5. Getting really confused between Venue and Creta even though the price difference is 3L which is not a huge burden to say but I am concerned about how big of a vehicle it is when riding alone.

A heated marital dispute between world champion boxer **Sweety Boora** and her husband, kabaddi player **Deepak Hooda**, has escalated into a public spectacle. The controversy took a dramatic turn when Boora was caught on video **physically assaulting Hooda inside a Hisar women's police station**, where both had gone for a hearing related to their divorce case.  \n\nThe viral video shows Boora **grabbing Hooda by the collar** while family members attempt to intervene. The incident follows a series of allegations and counter-allegations between the two athletes, including accusations of **domestic abuse, dowry harassment, and property disputes**.  \n\nBoora has publicly accused Hooda of **physically and mentally torturing her since their marriage in 2022**, claiming that he demanded a **Fortuner SUV instead of the Creta car** that her family had initially planned to gift. She also **alleged that Hooda is interested in men** and promised to present evidence to support her claim.  \n\nMeanwhile, Hooda has accused Boora’s family of trying to **seize his property**, which Boora strongly denies.  \n\n**Sweety Boora’s Allegations:**  \n- **Dowry Harassment & Domestic Abuse:** Boora claims that Hooda and his family demanded a Fortuner SUV, leading her father to take a loan to fulfill the demand.  \n- **Neglect by Authorities:** She alleges that the **Hisar police have failed to act on her complaints** and that SP Sawan is harassing her instead.  \n- **Threat to Her Life:** Boora has stated that **if anything happens to her, Hooda and SP Sawan should be held responsible**.  \n- **Hooda’s Sexual Orientation:** She claims to have found **videos of Hooda with other men** and plans to release them as proof.  \n- **Financial Support:** Boora asserts that Hooda was financially weak when they met, even lacking a proper toilet at home. She says he **deposited money in her account in 2016 to evade taxes**.  \n\n**Deepak Hooda’s Claims:**  \n- **Property Dispute:** Hooda has accused Boora’s family of trying to **grab his assets**, an allegation she denies.  \n- **Counterclaims of Abuse:** While he has not directly accused Boora of domestic violence, the viral video of her attacking him in the police station has raised **questions about her behavior**.  \n\n## **Key Takeaways**  \n- The **marital dispute has turned physical**, with video evidence of Boora assaulting Hooda in a police station.  \n- **Serious allegations** have been made by both parties, including claims of dowry harassment, financial manipulation and Hooda’s alleged relationships with men.  \n- The case has gained significant media attention, with **Boora appealing to Prime Minister Narendra Modi for intervention**.  \n- Police inaction has been a major point of contention, with Boora claiming that authorities are biased against her.  \n- The dispute may **impact both athletes’ careers**, given their status as **Arjuna Award-winning sportspersons**.  \n\n## **Sources**  \n1.

Hello 👋 \n\nI am M32 and have been working on a project for more than 2 years now — The project is a web portal for people who find it difficult to get a job / wfh / remote etc and on a permanent basis! \n\nWe see most freelancers are not trusted enough with their work ethics and availability. Almost half the time, people think they are not serious enough to perform duties enlisted. This kind of becomes unprofessional and sometimes unethical. \n\nI am an advertising professional and have been a part of mainline and digital communications for as long as a decade now! I started my journey as a call centre exec with McDonalds process and later with Amex Ggn! \n\nAfter few job experiences, I chose to go with advertising and communications spanning entire 10 years of career into the field. I was a part of commercials like - Bournvita Taiyaari Jeet ki, H-Venue, Creta, Elantra, MoPH (Afghanistan), GSK Women’s Horlicks, Nutritrack App etc. \n\nMy past has kind of intrigued me into this as I have not been able to work with accumulated skills and knowledge. Being an MBA myself, I think job is much more easy than any business or startup in the end. I find it difficult that people who start lose and go back to their jobs due to financial instability! But if we give people the security and tasks that are required frequently as per the defined scope of work. Then it is way easier to manage multiple operations in a given period of a time! \n\nAs an easy fix, I have created a portal where people can post autonomous tasks for someone who is willing to give their time and value output for that specific purpose! \n\nRight now I am stuck at choosing tech stack that is simple yet dynamic. I have thought of considering the following-\n\nReactJs\nNodeJs\nPostgreSQL for database and I am thinking to shift to prisma for all I care! \n\nHave tried Next Js but I found it atrociously difficult to implement functionalities. But I thinking to consider it as it is way advanced with server side rendering! \n\nLastly, I am also looking for someone who can guide me through the pitch process as I don’t have enough knowledge in the startup world!\n\nLooking for suggestions and advice to take it further and probably expand across! \n\nThanks for reading!", "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "emojis": ["👋"], "location": {"profile_location": null, "geo_location": null, "nlp_location": null, "final_location": null, "tier": null, "country": "India", "state": null, "city": null}, "sentiment": {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.0}, "keywords": ["years", "making", "hello", "working", "project", "more"], "aspects": [{"aspect": "safety", "sentiment": "neutral", "score": 0.0}, {"aspect": "design", "sentiment": "neutral", "score": 0.0}, {"aspect": "price", "sentiment": "neutral", "score": 0.0}], "intent": "query", "embedding": null, "embedding_model": null, "processed_at": "2025-10-03T17:36:37.368995Z", "source_id": "reddit:f4cef28f1003", "target_vehicle": "Hyundai Creta", "vehicle_category": "Compact SUV"}

Fiat Strada with FIRE engine is considered reliable and simple to maintain and repair, as well as it has a good suspension to tolerate bad roads and streets from Brazil.\n\nSince here we are poor to own even one vehicle (it's extremely expensive to buy and own even a popular car), it's common to have sedans derived from subcompacts that is the case of the Chevrolet Onix Sedan. Then, the car must attend several needs for a family... from having good interior room and large trunk to reliability and fuel economy. \n\nI hope you like it.

Here is a list of cars sold in only certain parts of the United States, which means if it is say for instance, a Toyota Mirai, you can only buy those in California and Oregon. You'll see what I mean.\n\n**Hyundai Creta, i20, H1, and H100:**\n\nPopular Hyundai models in other markets. These four can be found in **American Samoa**. C'mon, at least bring the Creta here! I mean, it IS a crossover, and everyone loves those thing nowadays. Don't worry about the commercial vehicles. Everyone uses boxes on pickups now.\n\n**Honda Clarity FCV:**\n\nI was quite bummed to find out that they weren't selling ALL Clarity models across the US. They sell the EV and PHEV versions, though, which kinda makes me happy. The fuel cell Clarities sell on the **West Coast** as they don't have fuel cell stations all over and Honda would for some reason hate for some other American to own one of their precious FC Clarities. They should make a Honda website specifically for the West Coast if they don't want to sell it all over the US.\n\n**Mazda 2 Hatchback:**\n\nThe Mazda 2 once sold in the United States as a hatchback, but the sales were... bad. They now sell the sedan version of the current one (with a different grille) as the Toyota (formerly Scion) iA. Now in **Puerto Rico** (a territory of the US), you can buy a Mazda 2 Hatchback and even the Toyota iA.\n\n**Most cars in the 50 States:**\n\nMost cars sold in the **50 States United States** can't be imported to Guam, Puerto Rico, Northern Mariana Islands, American Samoa, and US Virgin Islands because they are just to hard to ship overseas constantly. That is why there are mostly Toyotas in those places.\n\n**Toyota HiLux, HiAce, Fortuner, LC78, LC79, and LC Prado:**\n\nLet's play a game where you pick which cars you wish they sold here: I choose the LC ones. The HiLux and Fortuner sold in **American Samoa** are old. Even their RAV4! The HiAce is pretty cool too, but that won't work here as it doesn't fit our Ford F-150-Chevrolet Malibu-Toyota Camry style.\n\n**Toyota Mirai:**\n\nThe Toyota Mirai is a cool fuel cell vehicle that looks like a Corolla had a baby with a Prius after the Prius made out with a fish. I wish it was sold all over the United States but is can only be sold where they have fuel cell stations; the **West Coast**. Even though it looks like [this,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9o19CaOSuD8) it is a pretty cool car.", "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "emojis": [], "location": {"profile_location": null, "geo_location": null, "nlp_location": null, "final_location": null, "tier": null, "country": "India", "state": null, "city": null}, "sentiment": {"label": "negative", "score": -0.57}, "keywords": ["cars", "you", "buy", "united", "states", "here"], "aspects": [{"aspect": "mileage", "sentiment": "negative", "score": -0.57}, {"aspect": "performance", "sentiment": "negative", "score": -0.57}, {"aspect": "design", "sentiment": "negative", "score": -0.57}], "intent": "query", "embedding": null, "embedding_model": null, "processed_at": "2025-10-03T17:36:37.371074Z", "source_id": "reddit:d074e2d88742", "target_vehicle": "Hyundai Creta", "vehicle_category": "Compact SUV"}

Hello folks,\n\nI'm going to buy my first car but I can't decide how much to pay and what car to buy. I have seen so many options that I just don't like a specific car, but I think a reliable automatic/CVT sedan would be nice.\n\nI'm 24 living in Central America and my annual income is around $26k. I live with very little expenses because I live my parents and they will help me with $10k - $15k for my first car. My family has very good economy.\n\nA first option that I have is a Honda CR-V 2012 EX with leather seats and rear camera. It's my grandfather's car and he no longer wants it (I would call it the family car because when someone needs to do some trip or go to a particular place, they take it from my grandfather).\nIt has around 80k km with some cosmetic damages. He can give it to me for $15k.\n\nA second option that I have is a Yaris. A used 2015 - 2017 Yaris range from about $14k to $15k. They are very basic with 2 airbags and no real other extras like camera or sensors unless you buy it to third party. New Yaris start at over $20k probably.\n\nA more expensive option that I'm thinking of is buying a used 2018 Corolla SE blue/purple I found that I think is nicely priced at $20k but is pricey based on my annual income, isn't it? And doesn't have rear camera or sensors. \n\nI was thinking probably it's too much car to just start driving. Why 2018? Well its the new version of Corollas and this one has 8 airbags which is quite cool and safe. \nOther previous version used to have only 2.\n\nAnother options are some economy-compact SUVs that I somewhat like that are 1600cc and range from $20k like Nissan Kicks, Hyundai Creta or Suzuki Vitara (not grand).\n\nAppreciate some opinions and questions to finally help me decide something soon! :)\n\nPD: another thing that I have to add is that this car is for some short commutes but who knows if in the future I will have to travel larger distances. Still my work most of the time have 2-3 days Work from home and commute is crowded but is 4km each trip.", "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "emojis": [], "location": {"profile_location": null, "geo_location": null, "nlp_location": null, "final_location": null, "tier": null, "country": "India", "state": null, "city": null}, "sentiment": {"label": "positive", "score": 0.43}, "keywords": ["analysis", "paralysis", "buying", "first", "car", "help"], "aspects": [{"aspect": "mileage", "sentiment": "positive", "score": 0.43}, {"aspect": "comfort", "sentiment": "positive", "score": 0.43}, {"aspect": "safety", "sentiment": "positive", "score": 0.43}, {"aspect": "price", "sentiment": "positive", "score": 0.43}], "intent": "query", "embedding": null, "embedding_model": null, "processed_at": "2025-10-03T17:36:37.374980Z", "source_id": "reddit:870503b9f4c3", "target_vehicle": "Hyundai Creta", "vehicle_category": "Compact SUV"}

I don't go that fast, usually drive within the speed limits of our roads which is less than 100.\n\nTucson features are very good with spacious rear seat.. performance is kind of between Tiguan and meridian.. pickup not as good as Tiguan but better than Meridian. Mileage is also good.\n\nMeridian get all features of Tucson including adas level 2. The moment I entered and shut the door down.. it feels very premium and just feels like sitting in a tank. Also, it's independent FSD suspension has good ride quality and stability on road. \n\nThe max capacity that can load as per weight rating is 2.5 tons for meridian, 2.3 for Tiguan, 2.1 for Tucson... so meridian is more suitable for 5 passengers and full luggage \n\ncoming to negatives.. \nTiguan \n as mentioned i am not a driving enthusiast.. so even i liked the performance of it, just feels like spending around 46 to 47 laksh on road for it is not my thing. \n\nTucson has premium cabin but the it still has some issues like creta.. the seat material is leatherette not leather.. the center console is making squeaking sound sometimes if my leg touches it.. we can see it shaking with little force not the case with other 2.. even though the kerb weight is 1775kg which is more than Tiguan (around 1650) and near to meridian at(around 1790).. somehow you don't get the feeling of sitting inside a very safe vehicle.. also the rear turn indicators placed on bumper is a big let down.. in Indian driving conditions.. very difficult to manage as it won't be visible to the vehicles behind us if they are close to us.. If any other Tucson users can share feedback about this, it would be great if they feel any issue.\n\nMeridians gearbox  is a big let down.. you won't feel the punch in the engine with very linear power delivery.. even if you press hard, you won't feel the performance like the other 2. \n\nI and my brother has toddlers, so 3rd will be useful in a couple of years time to atleast next 10 years until they become teenagers..\n\n\nso, I kind of decided to go for jeep meridian, after some discounts I am getting overland 4x4 with adas level 2 at 46 lakhs onroad in Hyderabad.. is this a good deal.. only question is will jeep exit Indian market?..

Here’s how…. Disclaimer: Before I begin, let me tell you that this post will be very very valuable to people looking to purchase a new car from any brand name be it Hyundai, Kia, Škoda, Audi, BMW, Mercedes or any other auto brand there is in India. It will save you at least lacs of hard earned money. Do comment the best discounts you’ve bargained for on your new cars to help others as well.\n\nI am talking about May 2025 manufactured model. Black S(O) IVT (petrol automatic). Latest 2024 Creta facelift right out of showroom (brand new - first owner). I live in New Delhi but I got it under my name on road in Faridabad, Haryana because the RTO was INR 40-45k cheaper. But hang on, I’m not even counting that price difference when I say I got an INR 1.2 lacs (ex-showroom) discount on my new Creta. If I were to add that difference, it would be 1.6 lacs on road discount on my new Creta.\n\nThe quote I got was INR 16.95 lacs on road Faridabad. For reference, it costs INR 18.10 lacs on road. The difference is huge!! To be precise, it’s INR 1.15 lacs for a brand new car. Apart from this, I also bargained for accessories worth 4K+ (Mud flaps, Door Mats and Perfumes) and 5L fuel top up and 800 fast tag recharge. So the net price difference comes out to be INR 1.20 lacs+. NOW THIS IS THE BEST DEAL YOU COULD EVER GET ON A NEW CRETA which is the No. 1 Top Selling Car in India with roughly 18,000 units sold every month!! Unlike other cars, the dealers don’t even offer you any discounts upfront. The only negotiation that happens is on the delivery date. Not even any exchange bonuses even for this one!\n\nSo, how did I actually get such an impressively unimaginable quote?? Here’s my story,…. So it took me a total of 1 week of full-time hardwork to crack this deal. But, don’t worry, I’ll share with you all my research so that you do not have to go through the grind.\n\nNow, before I begin my strategy, I’ll tell you a very important insight. The NH1 highway in the North Western end of Delhi which runs from Sonipat to Ludhiana has showrooms which offer the best discounts across India. And this is not just for Hyundai, it’s across brands. This is because all the auto wholesalers (Direct Selling Agents) are established there. They deal in bulk and also send cars to many showrooms across India. This is where I began.\n\nSo my first step was to one by one ring up all the Hyundai showrooms starting from Ludhiana. I first prepared a list of all the cities which the NH1 highway runs through. Then, I ran a ChatGPT deepsearch on the list of these cities to provide me a table of all Hyundai Showrooms in these cities with their contact details. It took 15 mins to run that deepsearch. Once done, I copy pasted it into a Google sheet and added 2 more columns; status of calling, best offer. This helped me keep things organised.\n\nThen, I began calling these showrooms starting from Ludhiana. I had a starting figure of the discount to quote based on the quotation I received from a local showroom! We had already managed a discount of INR 50k somehow from some Hyundai Showroom in Gurugram which we had good contacts in. And that was after stretching them to the most extreme bit at their end. The final quote we had received was of INR 17.55 lacs on road. Now this is what I started to pitch the other showrooms on NH1. I would call them and tell them that I already had a quote and send it to them on WhatsApp and ask if they had a better offer.\n\nOne of these guys was very straightforward. The first sentence he said was, “Ji bargaining krni hai ki seedha best offer du?” I was elated to hear this and promptly responded, “Ji aap best offer bataiye”. This guy offered me a quote of INR 16.97 lacs on road (for S(O) IVT) on the call. That is a whopping INR 1 lacs+ discount on the on road prices of these variants. He denied to send an offer on WhatsApp or mail. Now I was slick to record that call. I used the recording as a proof to bargain with other showrooms down the NH1.\n\nAfter 3 days of follow-up calls, we finally got a better deal at INR 16.95 lacs from another nearer showroom at NH1. But it was still 200 kms away from our location and wasn’t providing any accessories. So we brought that deal closer by contacting the showrooms which were nearer to our location again. These showrooms had earlier rejected the 16.95 lacs offer (and barely offered a maximum discount of INR 55-60k) yet this time when we genuinely reached out to them with our plea to bring the deal nearer with all the proof of recordings and quote on mail, they agreed because we promised to book immediately. What’s even better, we also bargained for accessories this time and these showrooms were within a 70km radius so we saved a lot of travel cost.\n\nWe finally closed the deal at INR 16.95 lacs on road (with mud flaps, 3D door mats (3.5k), 5L fuel top up, fastag (800)) (S(O) IVT).\n\nManufacturing date of this cars was in May/June 2025. Colour: Black (S(O) IVT). Delivery was within 2 days (which it took for financing). Booking amount was 11k.\n\nBonus Tip: We also got an interest rate of 7.8% on our loan from PNB. All other banks were offering roughly 9% interest rate (ICICI: 9.1, AXIS: 8.8, HDFC: 9.1). The showroom helped us get that. They put in a lot of effort there for us (it took the sales person half a day of talking to banks).\n\nPS: I cannot disclose the showroom names on this post because of ethical & legal reasons. However, please feel free to reach out to me in dm. I would love to help you guys out by connecting you to these showrooms for best discounts. This would also help me payback for all the effort their sales team put in for us.\n\nPPS: I also tried Ackodrive. They couldn’t offer me a quote better than this or anyway nearer even after removing the insurance margin. This was honestly the best bargain I could ever get.\n\nDo upvote if you found this post valuable. Do let me know in the comments if you need any other details. Also, please share with me in the comments the best discounts you guys may have received on your new cars.

Like, the rest of the world was out there in the 90s and early 2000s getting legendary two-seater RWD coupes—the Nissan 200SX, 240SX, 300ZX, Toyota AE86, Celica GT-Four—and what did we get? Maruti 800 and the Esteem? Fantastic.\n\nFast forward to today, and guess what? Still nothing. Want a proper RWD car in India? Hope you're ready to shell out 50+ lakhs for a BMW or Merc. Even if you somehow afford a used one, enjoy spending another fortune on maintenance. Meanwhile, in the US or Japan, you can pick up a decent RWD coupe for dirt cheap and build it into an absolute beast. Here? You get a Hyundai Grand i10 with fake vents and a \"sports edition\" sticker.\n\nAnd don’t even get me started on the average Indian \"car enthusiast.\" These guys are out here passionately debating whether a Hyundai i20 is better than a Suzuki Fronx—like bro, you’re literally comparing garbage to trash. People in the US are arguing about turbo builds, engine swaps, suspension tuning, and we’re over here talking about which budget hatchback is less of an embarrassment. If someone from Japan or the US heard these conversations, they’d think they walked into a clown convention.\n\nSpeaking of clowns, what’s with Indians throwing spoilers on their FWD econoboxes? News flash: Your Swift isn’t generating downforce, bro. That eBay wing isn’t doing anything except making your car look like a rejected Fast & Furious extra. And the best part? Most of them don’t even know their car is FWD. I once heard a guy say, \"Bhai, spoiler se grip badhti hai.\" Yes, sure, because your front-wheel-drive Alto totally needs rear-end downforce at a max speed of 80 km/h.\n\nAnd let’s talk about the Hyundai obsession. Why? Just… why? Korean engines are some of the most uninspiring and unremarkable pieces of machinery when it comes to performance. Sure, Hyundai has made some cool cars like the N series, but in real racing? Nowhere. No Le Mans, no Formula 1, no NASCAR dominance, and absolutely zero Nürburgring records worth mentioning. Yet somehow, every other Indian \"enthusiast\" will swear by their Creta like it’s a McLaren P1.\n\nBut you know what? It all makes sense. Indians missed the entire RWD sports car wave because the only thing they cared about was mileage and low service costs. That’s why legends like the Polo GT got discontinued—because people didn’t want to spend money on maintaining a car with actual driving dynamics. Meanwhile, Suzuki and Hyundai keep selling peasant-level trash because \"Kitna deti hai?\" is the only thing that matters.\n\nAt this point, calling yourself a car enthusiast in India is like calling yourself a professional swimmer after playing in a kiddie pool. The whole car scene here is a joke, and the worst part? No one even realizes it.\n\nTL; DR save me the trouble.

Its not that Taigun has no features, I would say that it has sufficient, on point features which any car enthusiast would require. There are not many gimmiky or flashy features but whatever it has I feel its enough. Its better to have features that are useful and relaible rather than having some which you might rearly use and when required might malfuction. 360 deg parking camera or atleast 360 sensors is a miss I feel.\n\nThere is always a saying that a german car means expensive maintaince, but i think that's long gone now. With services pakages worth around 40k, you are good to go for almost like 4 years. That is not much expensive. \n\nAnother thing that caught me by suprise while at VW Showroom is that the Virtus is actually cheaper than the Taigun.

Hi everyone,\n\nI am planning to buy a new car moving on from my Swift LDI. I'll be willing to exchange my swift at showroom as I am planning to buy the new car from my hometown and would only have a week to do so and that won't be enough time and would be too much hassle to sell it on my own. My criteria is as follows :\n\n- Decent features\n- Spacious and good bootspace\n- 2nd row comfort\n- Low maintenance and good service network\n- Not a very enthusiastic driver and 70% drive will be in city, anything that has decent power is good enough for me.\n- Decent mileage ( around 12-13 in city and 17+ on highway)\n- Automatic transmission as my wife prefers it. CVT or torque converter\n- Budget : 20L on road\n\nBased on above and already posted threads on this subreddit, below are the cars I considered:\n\n- Hyryder: Rejected as strong hybrid has less bootspace + out of budget and without strong hybrid the car does not interests me much.\n\n- Grand Vitara: Don't want to buy a maruti as all the interiors feel same to me and does not give a premium feel. + Same reasons as hyryder.\n\n- Kushaq/Taigun: Found these to be fun but the space seems to be lesser than what I have seen in other cars.\n\n- Creta: Looks like a complete car but my wife does not like it.\n\n- Seltos: In contention as it has a lot of features and checks almost all the boxes and my wife is also ok with it.\n\n- Elevate: Another competitor, I like its design and the no-nonsense feature list + honda's reliability + better safety than seltos(I believe)\n\nSo for now we are confused between Seltos HTX CVT and elevate ZX. Seltos has more features and based on what I have read till now may have a better mileage, it's 2nd row seating also seems to be better than Elevate + the exchange price I am getting for my swift from the showroom is lucrative which is bringing the overall cost to be very competitive. Elevate's design looks better to me, provides better safety and ivtec is battle tested. However I'm not sure about Honda's future in India.\n\nIn addition to this with the latest E20 fiasco, I was a bit influenced to go towards diesel again but my overall running is less than 10k per year so back to choosing petrol. Don't want an EV for 2 reasons I live in a rented flat, charging during long trips(1600km to my hometown and back, atleast twice in a year) seems inconvenient and as of now I have lesser trust on the ev infrastructure in the country.\n\n\nAll opinions are welcome!", "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "emojis": [], "location": {"profile_location": null, "geo_location": null, "nlp_location": null, "final_location": null, "tier": null, "country": "India", "state": null, "city": null}, "sentiment": {"label": "positive", "score": 0.43}, "keywords": ["help", "out", "choosing", "next", "car", "everyone"], "aspects": [{"aspect": "mileage", "sentiment": "positive", "score": 0.43}, {"aspect": "performance", "sentiment": "positive", "score": 0.43}, {"aspect": "comfort", "sentiment": "positive", "score": 0.43}, {"aspect": "safety", "sentiment": "positive", "score": 0.43}, {"aspect": "design", "sentiment": "positive", "score": 0.43}, {"aspect": "price", "sentiment": "positive", "score": 0.43}, {"aspect": "service", "sentiment": "positive", "score": 0.43}], "intent": "query", "embedding": null, "embedding_model": null, "processed_at": "2025-10-03T17:36:37.408894Z", "source_id": "reddit:2371fc07aa73", "target_vehicle": "Hyundai Creta", "vehicle_category": "Compact SUV"}

As this is the only time i could buy and after this i might have several expenses upcoming like childs education etc, couldn't resist the temptation.\n\nI ll keep the car for ten years minimum and wont change it in between no matter what the advancements are \n\n \nI dilligently invest 50k per year for NPS and 20k across mutual funds and 3000 per month in PPF after all my payments like EMI, ETC ETC..I also maintain a reserve corpus of 3 months salary  which is not touched at all.\n\nWithout touching the above investments I can put a downpayment of 5 lakhs and rest on loan.

I should note that these aren't \"true\" 60-100 mph tests. These results are taken from the 0-[end of run] tests from various car magazines. Typically, magazines will run three acceleration tests: 0-60, 0-100, and the quarter mile. All of these data points will come from the same run (or an average of a few runs). \n\nThus, the 60-100 time is simply the time it takes to go from 60 mph to 100 mph *while already accelerating*. In my opinion, a \"true\" 60-100 test would have the car cruising at 60 mph in an optimal gear and then goosing it from there. \n\nEnjoy. \n\n**Note: I learned recently that you can sort Reddit tables by clicking on the headers.

It's pretty obvious by now that the future of cars is going to be electric. But there are a number of issues at the moment that has me wondering whether plug-in hybrid vehicles (PHEVs) would be a better solution while we transition to fully electric cars (BEVs aka EVs).  There are a number of reasons why I think plug-in hybrids would make a better solution for the short term:\n\n1. 66+% of miles driven can be electric.  According to the Federal Highway Administration, Americans drive an average of 14,263 miles per year.  A Kia Niro PHEV (2022) can go 26 miles on a single charge.  That works out to be 9,490 miles per year, or a full 2/3rds of miles driven.  (This will be highly variable depending on the person/car of course)\n2. Affordability. We all know that the biggest cost for an electric vehicle is in the battery. Unfortunately, even with government subsidies and electricity savings, some people still can't afford the high cost of EVs at the moment.  A new Kia Seltos ICE starts at $22.8k, the Kia Niro PHEV starts at $29.6k, and the Niro EV starts at $40k.  Buying used EVs doesn't solve the problem because of the high cost of battery replacement.\n3. Reduce pressure on lithium mining while multiplying the benefit of any lithium mined.  Mining enough lithium for all the electric cars we're going to need isn't going to happen overnight either. The Kia Niro PHEV uses a 8.9 kWh battery whereas the Niro EV uses 64 kWh.  You could build \\*seven\\* Niro plug-in hybrids for the same amount of lithium to build one EV.  (Yet EVs are still only about 1/20th of new car sales) When combined with bullet point one, every pound of lithium mined could have 4-5 times the reduction in fossil fuels burned in cars.\n4. Allow charging infrastructure to catch up.  Charging infrastructure has always been a problem and seemingly will be for a while.  We can't build everything overnight.  Horror stories of people waiting in line to use a supercharger are the new range anxiety.  A PHEV can be charged overnight using any standard outlet.  Apartment complexes/condos can install a handful of standard outlets for the cost of a single EV charger. And if no outlet is available, it doesn't leave the driver stranded.\n5. It's an easier product to market to consumers.  For some people, an EV just isn't practical.  And there's always those people who don't deal well with change or technology (like the elderly).  With only a slight increase in cost, no range anxiety, and no special hardware required, nearly anyone who can own a pure ICE car can own a PHEV.  Worst case scenario they never plug it in and it spends it's life as \"just\" a hybrid.\n6. Battery replacement.  Batteries in plug-in hybrid vehicles will deteriorate over time just like in EVs.  But with such a smaller battery pack, a plug-in hybrid battery would cost much less to replace.  At current prices of $132/kWh, the Niro PHEV's battery only costs $1,175.  In the future, this price will drop even further and battery technology may even improve the range significantly by the time it needs replaced.  Buying used PHEVs will be less scary without the ticking time bomb of battery replacement.\n\nIn the future, when battery technology improves, costs come down, and charging infrastructure is everywhere, EVs will be a no-brainer.  Until then, plug-in hybrid vehicles could give us the best bang for our buck (pun intended) for reducing oil consumption in the meantime.  What do y'all think?\n\nEdit: updated to use the Seltos as a comparison vehicle for ICE only. It's slightly smaller than the Niro but has standard AWD which probably balances out. The Niro is not offered as ICE only, the base model is a non plug-in hybrid.", "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "emojis": [], "location": {"profile_location": null, "geo_location": null, "nlp_location": null, "final_location": null, "tier": null, "country": "India", "state": null, "city": null}, "sentiment": {"label": "negative", "score": -0.57}, "keywords": ["better", "off", "moving", "plug", "hybrids", "phevs"], "aspects": [{"aspect": "mileage", "sentiment": "negative", "score": -0.57}, {"aspect": "performance", "sentiment": "negative", "score": -0.57}, {"aspect": "price", "sentiment": "negative", "score": -0.57}], "intent": "query", "embedding": null, "embedding_model": null, "processed_at": "2025-10-03T17:36:37.449147Z", "source_id": "reddit:301e41a989eb", "target_vehicle": "Kia Seltos", "vehicle_category": "Compact SUV"}

The new [Kia Carnival] (https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/de/Kia_Carnival_KA4_red_diplomatic_%281%29_%28cropped%29.jpg) is obviously trying to buck that, but I haven't heard much of it working. I think most people still believe it to be a minivan.\n\n\nIs it the front wheel drive based platforms? Both the Sienna and Pacifica now come as AWD variants and most crossovers are front wheel drive based as well. The Mercedes R class was even available as rear wheel drive.\n\n\nWith the rise of captains chairs in SUVs I don't think it's that either.\n\n\nSo I'm stumped and now ask you, r/cars, what makes a vehicle a minivan to you, instead of a long crossover?", "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "emojis": [], "location": {"profile_location": null, "geo_location": null, "nlp_location": null, "final_location": null, "tier": null, "country": "India", "state": null, "city": null}, "sentiment": {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.0}, "keywords": ["what", "makes", "minivan", "wondering", "while", "car"], "aspects": [{"aspect": "mileage", "sentiment": "neutral", "score": 0.0}, {"aspect": "performance", "sentiment": "neutral", "score": 0.0}], "intent": "query", "embedding": null, "embedding_model": null, "processed_at": "2025-10-03T17:36:37.455602Z", "source_id": "reddit:c0c43a188ad6", "target_vehicle": "Kia Seltos", "vehicle_category": "Compact SUV"}

I posted a similar question to this in r/Kia , and was, unsurprisingly, met with some defensive and biased responses.\n\nFor background, I am an auto mechanic by trade, and more than any other manufacturer, by far, I see Kia, followed by Hyundai. Specifically Kia Soul, Kia Forte, Kia Seltos and Sorento. Majority of the issues are Rod Knock, Lifter Tick, General Engine Failure, and Transmission Failure. People who own these cars seem convinced it is because they sell at a higher volume than other competing cars, but the RAV4, CR-V,  Camry, and Corolla have all sold more than the competing Korean models, but are very rarely in the shop, or have issues in general.\n\nI personally know some people who's Hyundai/Kia have smoked, caught fire, or had melted engine components due to the ABS issue they have. Others have been targets for theft quite often.\n\nFrom a general, outside perspective, why do you think people spend their hard earned money on these vehicles ? Knowing the headaches they bring, the target they are for theft, the major motor issues they have, and the overall bad rep the dealers have for time it takes to get a warranty repair.\n\nI am in the auto industry, I've been in it my whole working life, these kinds of questions get to me, I want business, of course, but I see so many stressed, upset, and overall unhappy customers of these brands day In and day out.

Been saving money at my parent's house so I can either pay in cash or finance, whichever is the better deal. Been driving parent's 2015 Honda Accord in the meantime, and I love it. But, there's a high chance I'll be moving to a different state for a job, and I like hiking in the Appalachians; I want to be able to drive on service roads and do light offroading. So I figured I need AWD/4WD and a compact/subcompact SUV (bigger SUVs seem to be out of my budget).\n\n\n**Special considerations** \n\n* My employer has partnerships with Mazda and Subaru, so I have access to Mazda's S-Plan pricing and Subaru's VIP pricing, but both of them only apply to new vehicles\n\n* Single, no kids, need a daily driver that I can take through forest roads every other weekend\n\n*Key features I'd like - roof rack, unibody construction, blind spot detection, leather-trimmed seats, heated front seats, decent sound system (i.e. I don't need Harmon Kardon, but I like to blast music in the car, windows down), some ground clearance, reasonable technology and practicality\n\n\n**Other thoughts**\n\nI read that CVT is not very good. Just like everybody else, I'd like to have a reliable vehicle that's not expensive to maintain; not sure how long I'll be driving this, ideally until the wheels fall off.\n\nI really like the responsiveness and handling of the 2015 Honda Accord, no experience with more \"sporty\" vehicles so I'm still open to them\n\nOpen to used cars, but I'd probably want to aim for a Toyota or Honda, but not really sure what I should be looking for in my price range/desires\n\nI think the 2024 Kona and 2024 CX-30 are coming out soon, maybe I should wait for those?\n\nI read that this sub generally considers Hyundai/Kia to be unreliable, but they have the best manufacturer warranty. Hyundai/Kia can't be 2021 or older\n\nShould I stop shopping for new and strictly look for used instead just to be more cost-efficient? I keep hearing that the used car market is still bad, and that a new car doesn't cost that much more?\n\nRetaining some resale value would be nice. If I take a loan, I don't want to be underwater for it\n\nShould I consider hybrid/electric?

Are buying new Hyundai's really that bad?\n\nIn the market for a crossover SUV that has space. This will be the family vehicle. This is the class that includes:\n\nToyota Corolla Cross\nHonda HRV\nHyundai Kona\nChevy Trax\nSubaru Crosstrek\nKia Seltos\nEtc...\n\nSlightly used market is expensive, and not looking for a 2005 beige Corolla.\n\nOf the options I have seen, the 2024 Hyundai Kona Essential seems to check off the most boxes.  Good size, nice set of features, longer warranty, and good price.\n\nI have seen a lot of horror stories online about Hyundai engines, and warranty issues.  Not sure how much of what I'm reading is American based, and the vocal minority bias.\n\nBefore everyone jumps on the Toyota/Honda bandwagon, I do want to state upfront that it's cheaper to buy the Kona with an extended 8 year/160,000 km warranty than it is to get the base models of Toyota/Honda.  This is in comparison to the traditional 3 year, 60,000 km base warranty Toyota and Honda offer.  The Hyundai is also bigger and has way more features.\n\nAm I making a huge mistake investing in Hyundai?  Does it make sense to get the extended warranty given its a Hyundai.\n\nGiven that this is likely an American audience, for reference, 1KM = 0.621 miles\n\nEdit:  If Hyundai/Kia are really that bad, which vehicle in this class would you recommend?  I'm taking out Honda and Toyota from the equation based on price.  Unless I'm missing something, it's between the Subaru, Nissan, and Chevy.\n\nEdit 2: if Hyundai is really that bad, I'm now leaning towards the Chevy Trax Active trim.  It's a bit more expensive but comes with a few extra toys.  Without getting into it, for personal reasons the lower trims don't work for my situation.   I know American brands arent popular, but they are significantly cheaper.  Top trim is actually cheaper than the lowest trim of the Honda HRV and Toyota Corolla Cross.  Plus insurance is significantly cheaper than the Honda.", "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "emojis": [], "location": {"profile_location": null, "geo_location": null, "nlp_location": null, "final_location": null, "tier": null, "country": "India", "state": null, "city": null}, "sentiment": {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.0}, "keywords": ["are", "hyundai", "really", "bad", "canada", "buying"], "aspects": [{"aspect": "performance", "sentiment": "neutral", "score": 0.0}, {"aspect": "comfort", "sentiment": "neutral", "score": 0.0}, {"aspect": "design", "sentiment": "neutral", "score": 0.0}, {"aspect": "price", "sentiment": "neutral", "score": 0.0}, {"aspect": "service", "sentiment": "neutral", "score": 0.0}], "intent": "query", "embedding": null, "embedding_model": null, "processed_at": "2025-10-03T17:36:37.459260Z", "source_id": "reddit:7b10b3e00d27", "target_vehicle": "Kia Seltos", "vehicle_category": "Compact SUV"}

After much deliberation I have purchased a 2024 Trax. I know this decision violates the cult of Toyota, Honda, Mazda. And I will digently report any catastrophic mechanical failures. But I wanted to report on my experience and how I came to this decision.\n\nI set out aiming to spend less than 30k CAD (to avoid financing if possible).\nI test drove many cars and considered a number of subcompact SUVs and used compact SUVs. \n\nThe car was purchased for my partner to accomodate 2 small children and 2 adults. Fuel economy, cost of ownership, spaciousness were all considerations. \n\nI considered:\n\nMazda CX30 - nice inside, nice ride, cramped inside - 31,500k CAD\nUsed CX5 - nice ride, nice inside, surprisingly cramped - 31k CAD (2021 ~50k km)\nUsed Rav4 - kinda noisy, drove well enough, likely great reliability - 34k CAD (2020 ~50k km)\nUsed Tiguan - nice inside and out, drove great, concern about reliability - 32k CAD (2021 ~50k km)\nHyundai Venue - feels cheap, drives cheap, loud and crappy, tiny inside - 26k CAD\nNew Rav4 hybrid - again not particularly impressed with the inside, hybrid drove nice, fuel efficient, reliable - 45K CAD\nKia seltos - nice inside, decent ride, spacious - 32K CAD\nSubaru Forester - amazing visibility, drove well, reliable - 39K CAD\nCorolla Cross - meh inside, presumed good reliability, crap value equation - 36k CAD\n\nThe used market is still absolutely terrible where I am located. Most of what we considered was at or near base trim. All the prices are after tax in Ontario. Being able to purchase cash and avoid high interest fees was a factor.\n\nIn the end we purchased a 2024 Chevy Trax LS w convenience package for 27k CAD. The Trax is significantly more spacious than most subcompact SUVs and the ride quality has been great. It has all the features that matter to us and has been exceeding fuel economy marks.

{"platform": "reddit", "username": "wingsfan64", "timestamp": "2020-02-27T06:10:10Z", "vehicle_model": "Kia Seltos", "competitor_models": ["Tata Harrier", "Hyundai Creta", "MG Hector", "Maruti Grand Vitara"], "content": "Looking for my (age 24) first used car to take with me to Colorado.. **Hi all, I'm looking for my first car to call my own. 99% chance I'm buying used. At the bottom is my list of considerations. Here's way too much info that might help you help me:**\n\nFor starters, I don't know much about cars. I like watching the shows where they fix up old ones, but I probably couldn't tell you what most of the things under the hood are. Eventually I'd like to know enough where I could save some money doing some maintenance myself, but \"easy to work on\" is a low priority compared to the rest of this:\n\n* **Hatchback:**  I anticipate needing the space for moving and future activities. I also think they look cool. SUVs are too big, see driving experience below.\n\n* **Solid Gas Mileage:** Saving money can be tough, but I feel like this \"feature\" is built in. As much as I like long adventure drives, most of my driving will probably be in traffic. \n\n* **Safe:** I've never been in an accident but my parents might help chip in a little money if they think it's worth it to get a slightly more expensive car that's safer. \n\n* **Reliable:** I plan to treat it well, but I'd like something that can take a little abuse / doesn't need constant fussing over. I check carcomplaints.com to see which years are good and bad for each model car I'm interested in. \n\n* **Age/Miles:** I don't think I want anything older than a 2010 or over 120k-ish miles. This is quite flexible and I'm hoping you all can educate me on the pros and cons of age and mileage.\n\n* **Features:** I could care less if there are screens in the car, I'd actually prefer not to have any but it's no big deal. Mostly I'm looking for something with an Aux port and heated seats.\n\nHere's what I've driven in the past:\n\n*Loads of miles:*\n\n* **201? Hyundai Sonata V6:** with whatever the comfy seat package is. Family car, I really like the way it drives, and it checks most of my boxes except for not being a hatch. Could potentially buy the family car, but I don't think it would ever feel like *my* car. \n\n* **2014 Acura MDX:**another family car, it's too big for me. It drives big and parks big (I hate not really being able to tell how far forward I can pull into a spot) and doesn't corner as well as the Sonata (duh). I have no need for 3rd row seating. \n\n* **Early 2000s Honda Odyssey:** The family \"truck\" we abused forever. Aside from not wanting a minivan, I don't want something that accelerates this slowly.\n\n* **2014 Subaru Impreza Hatch:** This car would be perfect for me, although I worry about reliability given all the issues this particular one has had. It's small and zippy but still has a decent cargo area and it's built super safe. \n\n*Driven a bit:*\n\n* **Mazda 3** Another car I like, it definitely has some worrying years according to carcomplaints though.\n\n* **2013 Mazda CX 9** Probably a little too big, but at the time I was driving 4 other people around so it felt too small lol. Big fan of the blindspot alert lights on the side mirrors.\n\n* **2014 Jeep Wrangler** Oh boy this was a wild ride. Definitely too clunky for my needs though.\n\n* **201? Smart Car** I enjoyed it, but the safety is a major concern of mine and there's -1 cargo space. 10/10 would recommend strapping surfboards to the top.\n\n*Test Drives:*\n\n* **2014 Subaru Crosstrek** I liked almost everything about this car, my biggest complaint would be the wind noise. It sounds like you're driving with a window cracked all the time. Seat felt a little narrow, but I've been seeing that a lot in new cars?.\n\n* **2017 VW Tiguan** Meh. Far too clunky on corners and bumps for me.\n\n* **2019ish Hyundai Sonata** Yeah I definitely don't need any holographic displays. If it has a screen, it better have actual buttons and none of those stupid digital nested menus.\n\n*sat in at a dealership for fun:* \n\n* **Hyundai** Kona (love it), Veloster(love it, impractical), and Venue(smaller kona?). \n\n* **Kia** Niro (dream car, that MPG!), Stinger (seems fun, impractical), Seltos (not sure I sat in one, but it looks like Kia's version of the Kona or Crosstrek... I like it).\n\n* **VW** GTI (seems like a good fit), Golf (same as GTI it felt like)\n\n**Budget** my initial thinking was somewhere between $4k-5k, but I could afford a little more if need be. My parents are willing to chip in some as well (unclear what that amount is), as well as loan me some to pay back later. So it's a fairly wide range and *I don't know whether it's a better idea to get a cheap car for a few years and then upgrade on my own, or get something newer/better now that will last longer?* That's what I'm really hoping you can help me with.\n\nOkay, so here's what I'm considering, you guys can hopefully help me narrow the list down and/or discover something I haven't thought of:\n\n* 2014 Subaru Crosstrek (orange): owned and maintained by a Subaru mechanic, it has 80k miles and costs ~$12,500. A little more and some Blizzak winter tires and discount accessories (roof bars) would be included.\n\n* 2010 VW GTI (various): Lots of these for sale with over 100k miles, but they're closer to my original budget at $5k-7k. 2010 looks like a good year in terms of reliability.\n\n* 2010 Mazda 3 (black): This one has 130k miles, comes with lime green wheels that apparently cost $900. It's mine \"out the door\" for $4800. Honestly was close to pulling the trigger on this one except the carcomplaints site shows 2010 to be *considerably* worse than all the other years. I'd probably sell the wheels to buy snow tires. They're cool, but I don't need them. \n\n* Hyundai Elantra hatch? No research on this, but it looks okay and would probably cost less.\n\n* Subaru Impreza hatch. I'd be comfortable with this, but I don't really want to copy my sister. Still a valid option though.\n\n* Cheap Nissan Versa?\n\n* Used Hyundai Kona? I'd have to drive/fly to get it, but I found a used one for $14k\n\n* Honda Civic hatch? Maybe it's a sport? Idk, I think they look pretty cool honestly.\n\n* Any other year Mazda 3 hatch?\n\n* Any other year GTI (4-door hatch)?\n\n\nI know that was a lot, but I'd really appreciate your help. I really hope you guys can educate me on all of this.", "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "emojis": [], "location": {"profile_location": null, "geo_location": null, "nlp_location": null, "final_location": null, "tier": null, "country": "India", "state": null, "city": null}, "sentiment": {"label": "negative", "score": -0.57}, "keywords": ["looking", "age", "first", "used", "car", "take"], "aspects": [{"aspect": "mileage", "sentiment": "negative", "score": -0.57}, {"aspect": "performance", "sentiment": "negative", "score": -0.57}, {"aspect": "comfort", "sentiment": "negative", "score": -0.57}, {"aspect": "safety", "sentiment": "negative", "score": -0.57}, {"aspect": "infotainment", "sentiment": "negative", "score": -0.57}, {"aspect": "design", "sentiment": "negative", "score": -0.57}, {"aspect": "price", "sentiment": "negative", "score": -0.57}, {"aspect": "service", "sentiment": "negative", "score": -0.57}], "intent": "query", "embedding": null, "embedding_model": null, "processed_at": "2025-10-03T17:36:37.482032Z", "source_id": "reddit:a9a18c317c4d", "target_vehicle": "Kia Seltos", "vehicle_category": "Compact SUV"}

Hello,\n\nI live in Quebec and I never owned a car here. From where I'm from (Belgium) people would swear by VW (obviously haha) but doesn't seem the an obvious choice anymore the more I read. I will drive mostly in the city (Montreal) but plan to have a lot of trips out of town once I have a car. Might also do some off roads sometimes and a lot of snow driving since it's Quebec after all.\n\nI plan to lease during 48 months and eventually buy out the rest in the end or change car if it didn't work out with my initial choice.\n\n**The smart choice**: I love the Subaru Crosstrek because I drove one in the snow and felt very safe (I'm a nervous driver). It was also easy and comfortable to drive BUT it's a bit boring and not the most aesthetic car in that category.\n\n**The cool choice**: Mazda CX 30 I saw it in concession nearby and I found it very beautiful in and out.

Hi, everyone:\n\nI'm hoping you can help me with my pending decision.\n\nWife has had a 2007 Acura TSX since 2009 and it’s basically still fine, so she is obviously a big fan of the brand. \n\nLast year we added a 2022 Kia Seltos base model to the household because the Acura was having a few issues and we didn't wanna be stuck on the side of a road with a newborn. I was shocked that the 15 years older Acura has some features that the Seltos doesn’t, such as heated seats and preset seat positions. CarPlay and a backup camera were a welcome change, though. I actually prefer how the Acura handles, but the wife finds it a bit too heavy. Now with another munchkin on the way, as well as a dog, she wants to futureproof by upgrading to an MDX.\n\nI, however, do not want such a huge car. I’d prefer a large sedan or a wagon. My preference is Volvo, but am open to other brands. What is not under debate is our need for more interior space. When on road trips, the car is filled to the brim and doesn't make for a comfortable drive. My brother did try to tell me that SUVs aren’t necessarily more spacious than a sedan but I didn’t heed his advice and now with the Graco Extend2Fit in the middle seat I feel scrunched up when driving and I’m only 6’! \n\nIf we went new then it'd probably be a lease, otherwise cars around the 2020 year mark are probably in our budget, especially regarding Acuras/Volvos etc.\n\nI'd love a PHEV, but they seem to be out of budget at the moment, although the base model Mazda CX-90 plug-in would just about work.\n\nSo, my question to the experts in this sub is as follows:\n\nDo we need an MDX (or similar size SUV) or is a wagon going to be more spacious? Also, could a larger sedan meet our needs? If Acura made a wagon in the US then they'd be no issue here, but alas, America seems to hate the wagon.\n\nTLDR: Help me convince the wife off the MDX! (Might be futile; but a man can try!)\n\n\nThanks for your advice.\n\nEdit: I would be the main driver of any potential new car and the wife would use the Acura or Kia (if we don't trade it in or sell it) for her commute.", "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "emojis": [], "location": {"profile_location": null, "geo_location": null, "nlp_location": null, "final_location": null, "tier": null, "country": "India", "state": null, "city": null}, "sentiment": {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.0}, "keywords": ["mdx", "wagon", "sedan", "everyone", "hoping", "you"], "aspects": [{"aspect": "performance", "sentiment": "neutral", "score": 0.0}, {"aspect": "comfort", "sentiment": "neutral", "score": 0.0}, {"aspect": "infotainment", "sentiment": "neutral", "score": 0.0}, {"aspect": "design", "sentiment": "neutral", "score": 0.0}], "intent": "query", "embedding": null, "embedding_model": null, "processed_at": "2025-10-03T17:36:37.494293Z", "source_id": "reddit:ac93dc08dcc9", "target_vehicle": "Kia Seltos", "vehicle_category": "Compact SUV"}

Hello,\n\nI've been looking for a new daily driver on and off for the last year or so. I'm currently driving a 2016 Subaru WRX with around 120K Miles on it. While I enjoy driving it, using it as a daily driver has been wearing on me for a while. A heavy clutch in even moderate traffic gets old QUITE fast.\n\nMy criteria for a new car is:\n- Better Fuel Economy than the WRX\n- Similar insurance (but preferably lower)\n- At least somewhat engaging to drive\n- 20K USD max but if lower that's appealing \n\nIn my search so far, the 3/4 cars that come to the surface most often are: Mazda CX-30/Mazda 3, Honda Civic, and Volkswagen Jetta (1.4T).\n\nThe Mazdas are the most fun to drive, by far. The Honda certainly isn't bad, and neither is the Jetta. The Jetta and Civic had more supportive seats. The CX-30 is actually the cheapest of the bunch to insure (by about $20-$30 a month). The CX-30 unfortunately gets the worst gas mileage of the cars considered, but they're all on Regular anyway so it's not as much of a concern. \n\nThe Mazdas and Jetta can be had at or just under 20K fairly easily (some are even certified), whereas the Civic is a little harder to get there. Not impossible, but harder. \n\nHaving read a few posts before writing this one though, the idea of getting a new car did crop up. The local Kia dealership will sell you a Seltos or K4 for just under 23/24K. New Jettas are around the same in their base trim. I'm sure there's better deals to be had outside my local area. While the warranty is appealing, the added cost at purchase and (likely) higher insurance rates make this feel unappealing to me. \n\nLastly, I do intend to take our a loan for this vehicle. I am fully capable of paying for any of these cars in full on the day of purchase, but right now my Credit History is a little lacking, and I would like to set myself up for purchasing a home at some point. I was only going to take out a small loan so that there was no risk of me having issues paying it off. \n\nAre there other vehicles you think I should consider? Personal experience with any of these cars is also very welcome to hear. \n\nThank you!\n\nNote: I intend to get a second, \"fun\" car after this one is purchased and I sell my WRX.

(trade in is about 2k) \n\nOut of these, i really want the subaru... has low miles, it's a 6 speed and checks all the marks, but i've always heard some bad things about headgaskets \n\n1. 2014 Subaru Forester 2.5I Premium $17,998\\*64K miles (This is a 6 speed as well) \n2. 2018 Honda HR-V LX $18,998\\*58K miles\n3. 2019 Hyundai Kona SE $17,998\\*40K miles\n4. 2015 Toyota RAV4 LE $15,998\\* 121K miles \n5. 2021 Kia Seltos S $18,998\\*59K miles", "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "emojis": [], "location": {"profile_location": null, "geo_location": null, "nlp_location": null, "final_location": null, "tier": null, "country": "India", "state": null, "city": null}, "sentiment": {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.0}, "keywords": ["smaller", "budget", "emergency", "ish", "purchase", "current"], "aspects": [{"aspect": "performance", "sentiment": "neutral", "score": 0.0}, {"aspect": "design", "sentiment": "neutral", "score": 0.0}, {"aspect": "service", "sentiment": "neutral", "score": 0.0}], "intent": "praise", "embedding": null, "embedding_model": null, "processed_at": "2025-10-03T17:36:37.504701Z", "source_id": "reddit:60bed48938f3", "target_vehicle": "Kia Seltos", "vehicle_category": "Compact SUV"}

Hi All, \n\nMy mom was driving a 2016 (purchased in 2020) Buick encore and it was going to be paid off this month..so naturally it broke down and apparently metal shavings were found in the engine?? So anyway…time for a new vehicle. \n\nMy mom is very basic - she doesn’t need a vehicle with tons of features, just wants something to get her from point A to point B. Her job is about 50 miles from home and she puts about 18-20k miles on her vehicle per year. She wants a compact SUV or crossover of some sort. I really don’t want to go over $30k once all is said and done but can be flexible. Ideally she will get a loan term within the warranty terms so the major components of the vehicle will be covered the length of the loan. (Willing to do between 36-60 months for the loan terms and also new vehicles purchased with Hubler have a 10 year/200k mile warranty on top of manufacturers warranty). \n\nWith all the being said, every. single. vehicle. I look at seems like a good contender upfront. But then I look at reviews and hop on Reddit and within minutes I’m like ok nope need to remove it from the list. Everyone says stay away from CVT and stay away from 3 Cylinder Engine - this extremely limits the vehicle choices. There is something negative to be said about every single car brand. Hondas and Mazdas are the only brands I haven’t really read anything negative about. \n\nBelow is a list of some vehicles we were considering in no specific order: \n\n1. 2025 Chevy Trax \n2. 2026 Chevy Trailblazer \n3. 2025 Chevy Equinox \n4. 2025 Honda HRV\n5. 2025 Mazda CX5 or CX30 \n6. 2025 Toyota Corolla Cross \n7. 2025 Kia Seltos\n8. 2025 Kia Soul \n\nHonestly we were really feeling the Chevy Trax, it’s not much over 20k and isn’t super loaded with tons of features and seems perfect for her. But I’ve read TONS of bad reviews on this. Lots of reviews basically say stay away from Chevy and GM vehicles in general. \n\nHonestly, I don’t even know what I’m posting this for. Suggestions on a vehicle? Someone to tell me which of these are best? Any suggestions outside of these?  Tell me what I absolutely need to stay away from? I’m driving myself crazy looking at vehicles and am basically to the point of telling her to just choose whatever she wants bc major things will be covered under warranty…I just don’t want to be dealing with repairs within the first year like so many of the reviews I’m reading say.\n\nUgh.

My wife is currently driving a 2014 Jeep Compass. It's doing okay, but we are looking for something more fuel-efficient and smaller. (I know the Compass is not large, but she thinks it's too big...). Of course, we'd like a more reliable vehicle with a few more creature comforts. \n\nUnfortunately, she loves Kia Souls lol. She rented one a while back and loved how little and nimble it is. She knows they are not reliable, but she enjoys that size. I personally would like her to get something a bit larger like a CRV, RX, or XC60. Those have been at the top of my list for replacements for her current car. She's willing to test drive them, but she thinks they will be too large. For reference, she thinks my 22 Honda Accord is massive and refuses to drive it.\n\nAny advice here would be appreciated. I'll entertain the subcompacts, but I'm going to try to see if she can build her confidence with a \"larger\" SUV.\n\nSo far, I've looked into the Soul (newer models to avoid the Kia boys), Seltos, Trax, Kona, Trailblazer, UX, HRV, Corolla-Cross, etc. None of them stand out to me since they all cancel each other out in terms of what they offer. Some have decent creature comforts, but drive like shit. Some have terrible space, but decent tech.

She would be the primary driver, and it would mainly be a commuter. Even when we have kids, it's likely we would just use my car (hence why I bought the Accord).

Kia has been as difficult as possible and have given her every reason under the sun as to why they won’t honor her warranty. She changed oil at the dealer shops and on time and never made any modifications that should’ve voided her warranty. Finally Kia decided it was due to “bad gas” being put into the car.

Thank you for taking the time to read! Here's my situation:\n\nAm 22 years old with credit score in 780 range, and am looking to buy my first new car to replace my 2010 BMW 528i. Have been driving this car for 5 years; father bought it salvage title and came to me with 120,000 miles. It has been a nightmare from the start, though mainly due to my father's DIY \"upgrades\" that left me stranded on the highway a few times. I am mostly sure in my desire for a new car to have a bit more peace of mind that it won't shut down or break parts here and there at will.\n\nThat being said, I seriously have no one to turn to for decent advice on what car is a good buy - this is where you lovely people come in!\n\n\\-------------------------------\n\nPrice range: <$28,000 ---- Down Payment: $10,000 ---- Ideal Contract: $350/mo | < 48 mo\n\nLooking at a daily commute of 50 miles, mostly highway (live in SoCal city), with the occasional long drive (\\~150mi) up to vacation spots/family. Refuse anything less than 27 mpg (highway).\n\nNeeds: RELIABILITY + SAFETY >>> ALL \n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*Something that is not too costly to repair if needed and easy to maintain\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nSafety Wants : Back-up camera, Cruise Control, Automatic Emergency Brake/ Emergency Brake Assist, Froward Collision Warning, Blind Spot Warning, Rear-Cross Traffic Alert, Lane Departure Warning/ Lane Keeping Assist, Parking Assist Sensors. \n\nComfort/Convenience Wants : (Panoramic is a luxury) Sun/Moon Roof, enough space to comfortably fit 4 adults and 4 small luggages for the occasional trip, don't need a sport car but just something that doesn't take 15s to reach 60mph and allows for the occasional pass over on the highway.\n\n\\-------------------------------\n\nI am irrationally attracted to the subcompact SUV class for their looks - though am sticking to FWD/2WD; not necessarily looking for an off-roader vehicle but I like their look. \n\nCompact SUV currently on my high interest list at face value (all 2021): Hyundai Kona, Hyundai Venue, Kia Seltos, Kia Niro, Honda HR-V, Toyota CH-R, Mazda CX-3/30, Mazda CX-5.\n\nAlso completely down with a Sedan (all 2021): Hyundai Sonota, Hyundai Elantra, Hyundai Accent, Kia Optima/K5, Kia Forte, Honda Civic (+ Hatchback), Honda Accord, Toyota Camry. Toyota Corolla.\n\n\\----- My Thoughts -----\n\nI test drove the Hyundai Kona SEL PLUS and the Honda HR-V SPORT today - and am using my experience in these two to try and narrow down my scope. On the way they both drove - very smooth overall, felt a bit more in tune with the Kona than the HR-V but nothing make or break. For me as the driver, the cabin felt good, spacious, intelligent (liked its steering wheel display) and I could make do with the cargo space. The back seat space was too small though. My 6'4 brother could not get adjusted without making me compromise on my seat comfort and still had to duck and my 5'8 mom was left with about 2cm of leg room too. Plus the noted hard plastics were a lot more noticeable than I thought they would be which took a point away from my overall initial attraction to the car. But I can not deny that the standard safety features cross a lot off my list for a great price (Kona's got a $3,500 rebate/discount this month till 04/30/2021!) Plus the Warranty on Hyundai's give me peace of mind. \n\nThe HR-V was to me an all-rounder. The Sport trim had paddle shifters which I was too timid to mess around with on unfamiliar roads, but got me excited that I didn't have to give up the sportiness/ acceleration I got used to in my BMW (I think that's what they'll do at least). The back seat room was actually comfortable and spacious for my family and the cargo space was great too. The \"coupe\" look its got going on makes it look sportier than I expected and gained points for that. The interior feel/finish is what I would've wanted from the Kona but the informant display was a little lacking and unusual for me to navigate compared to the Kona. But I know I need time to learn to use it and the general consensus that Honda = Reliable is comforting me to let go of the stronger Hyundai warranty.\n\nIf I could get the safety features (+that moonroof) that come standard on the Kona, on the HR-V (without having to upgrade trims) and get the 6yr/10yr Hyundai warranty - I would've signed today. \n\n\\-- My Questions/Concerns --\n\nSo I guess that's what I'm looking for? But am I naive to expect all Honda's to be reliable? I know that the knowledgable car community feels a certain type of way about CV Transmissions but are they really all that bad for the kind of driving I do? What cars should I drop from my list now in your opinion? Not too concerned with devaluation since I plan to drive this car for as long as I safely can, but should I care more about that? I had planned on privately financing my loan and not through the dealer - is this dumb due to the missed rebates? Any tips on which banks to finance from if not dumb? I have general anxiety with driving as a whole, which is why I really want hella safety features in a compact package because city parking is a joke - but am I expecting too much? Should I give more thought to a (lightly lightly) CPO over a New car? Should I expand my budget for a Hybrid if I can? \n\nIf you made it this far I sincerely thank you.

MG Hector vs Hyundai Alcatraz | Which one to go for??\n\nWould like to get answers from all on this... \n\nThe below points are my thoughts after taking a long test drive on both vehicles. \n\nBoth models are Petrol Automatic \n\nHECTOR  - (Since we are looking for 5 seater, and non ADAS version)\n* I'm amazed at the spacious and comfortable interiors of the Hector \n* The suspension was great in the Hector and any bumps and potholes on the road were practically not felt at all\n* The engine felt good and responsive.. \n\n* The ADAS felt disappointing since the calibration was not upto the mark\n\n* The infotainment screen does have a niche feel to it, but I felt adding more buttons and knobs could have made it more user friendly\n\n* The in-built maps is from mapmyindia which wasn't showing very accurate results so, now sure if that was just with the test vehicle or broader issue\n\n* The biggest concern I have is the FE, because anyone and everyone I know has mentioned of Hector being a guzzler...now I'm not sure how true that is. But getting only 6-8.kmpl even after 10k kms...seems concerning \n\nNow, onto the next\n\nALCAZAR (7 seater top end, petrol automatic)\n\n* The look of the Alcazar was good and gave a good SUV feel,\n\n* Driving it felt great with all the the functions & features felt quite integrated into the vehicle.\n\n* The screen was visibly smaller compared to Hector, but since other vital controls such as radio, HVAC, and so on have knobs so it dint really make a difference.\n\n* The car did rev louder than the Hector when I switched to Sports mode, but the pick up was better on the Alcazar \n\n* The ADAS was far better synced and calibrated to indian roads and felt genuinely useful while driving compared to Hector, where it felt more of a distraction \n\n* The cabin space felt decent but, since Alcazar doesn't offer 5 seater variants, we were forced to test drive the 6 seater one, and my family doesn't want the captain seats in the second row, so will have to look at the 7 seater \n\n* Providing ventilated seats in the second row was a big plus as the Hector did not have that\n\n* Android Auto and Apple Car Play was available only wired mode and not wireless, which was a let Down, compared to Hector which has wireless \n\n* The wireless charging pad was really well placed and charged uninterrupted, whereas in Hector, the charging kept getting paused even with the vehicle being standstill.\n\n* The FE claims and what I'm hearing is not too bad with 12-14 kmpl being said for the Petrol Auto variant too\n\n* Looking at the 7 seater is a necessity more than a need, so most of the time the last row would be folded down for the boot space\n\n* However, I felt the second row was less spacious compared to the Hector, obviously, the vehicle dimensions matter, but with Alcazar, if the driver seat is pushed back all the way, the person sitting behind was not comfortable \n\n\nWith the onroad price of Alcazar falling just about 26Lac and Hector being 27 lac(non ADAS) I'm not sure which to go with\n\n\nI'd love to know if I've missed anything and if there's anything else that I should also consider", "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "emojis": [], "location": {"profile_location": null, "geo_location": null, "nlp_location": null, "final_location": null, "tier": null, "country": "India", "state": null, "city": null}, "sentiment": {"label": "positive", "score": 0.43}, "keywords": ["hector", "hyundai", "alcazar", "one", "buy", "alcatraz"], "aspects": [{"aspect": "mileage", "sentiment": "positive", "score": 0.43}, {"aspect": "performance", "sentiment": "positive", "score": 0.43}, {"aspect": "comfort", "sentiment": "positive", "score": 0.43}, {"aspect": "infotainment", "sentiment": "positive", "score": 0.43}, {"aspect": "design", "sentiment": "positive", "score": 0.43}, {"aspect": "price", "sentiment": "positive", "score": 0.43}], "intent": "query", "embedding": null, "embedding_model": null, "processed_at": "2025-10-03T17:36:37.529930Z", "source_id": "reddit:36a38ed24ccb", "target_vehicle": "Hyundai Alcazar", "vehicle_category": "3-Row SUV"}

Hello! It’s been a while since my last post on this community. The car completed 9 years last week, and the odometer now stands at 228k kms—happily chugging along.\n\nRegarding the AC not working properly, I initially got it serviced, which lasted for only a week, and eventually had to replace the entire AC system. One observation—NVH has reduced noticeably after the AC replacement.\n\nThe tyres were changed to CEAT Securadrive at 222k kms; I got a good deal on Amazon for them. The battery was also replaced, as the old one had weakened over the past two years.\n\nParts for periodic maintenance are on order and will be installed before it hits 230k kms. I also replaced the fog lamp housing with Uno Minda units and upgraded the bulbs to Osram 4300K LEDs. These have helped with visibility at night, though visibility still suffers during rain.\n\nFuel efficiency has dropped to 15 kmpl for some reason—I blame the pending service, especially the overdue EGR cleaning. Despite this, the car still feels fresh and confident, whether it’s a 30 km daily commute or a 500 km temple run.\n\nWe’re still looking to add another car to the garage, as my father and I are currently managing with just the S-Cross.

Hello All,\n\nI am torn between the decision of purchasing between the two as I am looking for a 6-7 seater petrol car within the range of 25 Lacs.\nThe preference is towards buying a car which has better ground clearance due to Gurgaon's worsening potholes.\nHowever, here are my major points of contention to make the decision - \n1. Mileage - I have a commute of 40Kms via Dwarka Expressway and internal highways. If anyone can suggest me the real world mileage of both cars in peak traffic, cruising between 40-60 in city and on Highways \n2.

TL;DR - We bought a brand new Innova in April, the car has been LEAKING WATER due to the rains and other sensors have been malfunctioning as a result. Dealer (and the manufacturer) want to repair the car and give it back to us, while believe we should be refunded or given a new car as the vehicle we received is clearly faulty and not safe to drive.\n\nPlease help retweet - https://twitter.com/abhishek_ko/status/914092290074914816\n\nWater Leakage Videos - https://youtu.be/oh9kJudBYPs\n\nNonstop Sensor Alarms - https://youtu.be/hv98XEQm9ek\n\nImages - https://imgur.com/a/mkacC\n\n\nHello all,\n\nMy family recently purchased a brand new new petrol Toyota Innova Crysta from Shinrai Toyota in Mumbai in the month of April.  Currently, the car has only driven 1800-2000 KM since purchasing it so it is still in brand new condition.\n\nDuring the past few months we have experienced unbelievable problems with the car and I just wanted to spread the word and let other people know to be wary before they decide to purchase the “reliable” Toyota Innova Crysta.\n\nOur problems started when the cheaply made interior plastic door panels broke within the first few weeks. We complained and fought with them and managed to convince them to replace it. The door panels are so poorly made that the paint coating on them is already peeling (Even on the replacement) after just a few months of light use. The leather lining on the passenger door panel also has started to peel out from the seams.\n\nLast month, while driving the car, the trunk open light and indicator started beeping and flashing and wouldn’t turn off even though we repeatedly tried to switch off the car and re-open and close the trunk. There was also some other warning light displayed. We didn’t think much of it at the time, and took the car to the dealer be checked. They claimed that the trunk wasn’t closed properly, and that water may have entered the petrol tank (possibly because the pump we filled it at scammed us according to the CSR Rep at Shinrai - we fill up our tank at Hindustan Petroleum in south Bombay and I highly doubt they are mixing water in their petrol). They “fixed” it and we took the car back. We also noticed some water in the trunk and utility area in the trunk but thought that it might just be spilled water or condensation so we didn’t pursue it further.\n\nThen recently, while driving in the rains, we were lucky to notice that water was actually LEAKING into the car in the trunk area from multiple locations! I documented the leakage and have posted the video links below. The car is leaking from multiple locations, so it is not an isolated issue. Clearly, water is also leaking into the petrol tank as the CSR rep at Shinrai told us that one of the alarm indicators was caused by water in the tank. \n\nHow is it possible that a BRAND NEW Toyota Innova (a hallmark of quality and safety in the industry) managed to get passed quality control if the car is leaking water during rains. The trunk open light continues to sporadically beep and blink for hours at a time (we often drive 2-3 hour distances in the day for work). Im guessing the sensor or electrical wiring is damaged from the water leakage. We’ve also been experiencing a rattling noise which seems to be coming from the front of the car, but we haven’t been able to recreate that to record it on video. We’ve had to drive 2-3 hours at a stretch with this alarm constantly beeping in the background multiple times!\n\nWe contacted the main Toyota-Kirloskar (they are the manufacturers of Toyota in India) office and they sent a representative to talk to us. They claim that nothing is wrong with the car and its just a small problem which they will fix in the dealers service center, and that its a very normal issue. \n\nI refuse to believe that this is a normal issue, I’ve never heard of a brand new car LEAKING WATER during rain. If the factory couldn’t properly test the waterproofing of the car, I find it extremely hard to believe that other critical safety components are thoroughly tested (airbags, brakes, crash-testing, etc). \n\nPlease look at the images and videos I’ve uploaded and help us share this message so that people are wary before they blindly trust a once reputed brand. \n\nImages - https://imgur.com/a/mkacC\n\nWater Leakage Videos - https://youtu.be/oh9kJudBYPs\n\nNonstop Sensor Alarms - https://youtu.be/hv98XEQm9ek", "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "emojis": [], "location": {"profile_location": null, "geo_location": null, "nlp_location": "Mumbai, India", "final_location": "Mumbai, India", "tier": "Tier-1", "country": "India", "state": "Maharashtra", "city": "Mumbai"}, "sentiment": {"label": "negative", "score": -0.57}, "keywords": ["toyota", "innova", "crysta", "bought", "leaking", "water"], "aspects": [{"aspect": "mileage", "sentiment": "negative", "score": -0.57}, {"aspect": "performance", "sentiment": "negative", "score": -0.57}, {"aspect": "safety", "sentiment": "negative", "score": -0.57}, {"aspect": "design", "sentiment": "negative", "score": -0.57}, {"aspect": "price", "sentiment": "negative", "score": -0.57}, {"aspect": "service", "sentiment": "negative", "score": -0.57}], "intent": "query", "embedding": null, "embedding_model": null, "processed_at": "2025-10-03T17:36:37.534922Z", "source_id": "reddit:55ac3ba1f225", "target_vehicle": "Toyota Innova", "vehicle_category": "MPV/3-Row"}

I had heard so much about the new 6-lane expressway between Bengaluru and Mysuru. I decided to try it out for myself.\n\n#My experience\n\n1. To start with, the toll booths are constructed. But they are not functional yet.\n2. The maximum speed limit is **100 Kmph**.\n3. There are still 3-4 breaks in the expressway at which 3 lanes of fast moving vehicles merge into one lane. An inexperienced driver may not be able to drop to 20 Kmph from 100 kmph within 5 seconds.\n4. 2 wheelers and autorickshaws are plying on the expressway (something that is disallowed on this expressway).\n5. There are no speed cams to check over-speeding.\n6. During the day time, I was in the middle lane, going at 100 Kmph. In the rearview mirror, I saw a Toyota Fortuner and an Innova bearing down on me. One overtook me from the left and the other overtook me from the right. They were speeding at 120+ Kmph. And this happened multiple times with the same models of cars.\n7. Large trucks were moving slowly on the rightmost and middle lanes (which is meant for the fast moving vehicles)\n8. There are breaks in the expressway to let in vehicles from the nearby town. There ought to be a long curve in the road that merges into the expressway, so that both the drivers can see each other for atleast 150 metres before the roads merge. But the entry from the town into the expressway is very abrupt. I saw a teenager enter the highway on a 2-wheeler. On the expressway, a car was moving at 100 Kmph on the leftmost lane. There was a collision and the teenager died on the spot. And this is not an isolated incident. It is not being reported in the media; because the state government is marketing the idea that the travel time between Bengaluru and Mysuru would be reduced to 90 minutes!\n9. On the way back, I traveled at night. In between there are stretches that have zero lights, no lane markings on the road and no way to distinguish the wall from the road.\n\n#Need of the hour\n\n1. Install speed-detecting cameras all along the expressway.\n2. Provide road lights and lane markers in the full stretch of the expressway.\n3. Automated traffic tickets should be sent to the owners of vehicles who break the traffic rules on this expressway\n**Over-speeding**, **Trucks and other heavy vehicles** wandering away from the left-most lane, **2-wheelers and autorickshaws** entering the expressway (as per rules, they are not allowed on the expressway)\n\n#PS: Drive safe\n##Be predictable to other vehicles. Simple things like:\n1. Stay within the speed limit\n2. indicate when you want to change lanes\n3. use hazard lights and the emergency brake, if you need to slow down suddenly (at a diversion, for example)\n4. overtake only from the right side.\n5. Anticipate rash, rule-breaking driving from all other drivers on the road.\n\nPlease keep this post in mind if you plan to drive between Bengaluru and Mysuru using this 6-lane expressway.

My dad used to have ₹3L/month salary in UAE which he left because of his ego. He started his business and failed and lost ₹50L. He again got a job for 1.5L/month and he left within 1 month because of his boss scolding him. He also didn't upskill this time. He's now jobless and the best offer he could get is ₹28K in Bangalore without food and rent. \n\nMy mom got a government school history teacher job with a starting salary of ₹25k but after 5 years, it'll become ₹50k. But she didn't go, instead decided to be a housewife. I appreciate her deciding to look after us. But she now spents ridiculously on food items, gadgets and clothes despite not having any income. She's also thinking of buying a new Innova Crysta worth ₹30L when neither my mom nor my dad has any income. They  have decided to sell our land for ₹30L and buy the car 🤦‍♂️\n\nMy dad didn't do any savings with the few middle eastern money he got. Instead spent it on iPhones, Raybans, Laptops and luxury clothes.\n\nCurrently, they only have a rental income of ₹30k but have to pay back ₹15L as loan amount. As a highschooler, I can't seem to do the daily expenses  with the leftover amount. Even my tution teacher scolds me for not paying the tution on time. Keep in mind that the tution amount is only ₹1500/month. And they can't even pay that amount. \n\nParents are not really worried about financial safety. They say money comes and goes which I think is dumb. A single hospital bill is enough to collapse our family and they don't get it.\n\nMy dad thinks that it's time to enjoy the wealth since he's getting old but he already spent all the wealth he made in the first place buying useless items. \n\nNot being an ungrateful brat, but I think they could have made better decisions and secured our family's financial future. They could have easily saved 2-3 crores for retirement and expenditures provided that my dad had a salary of ₹3L/month without any expenses in UAE.\n\nNow, they'll have to suffer when they are sick and spent time in a cheap hospital and not afford anything on their death bed with their money alone. I'll have to work hard and get a good job, pay off ₹5L bachelor's loan, ₹40L masters abroad loan and also ₹15L loan my parents took while also maintaining my parent's expenditures, my expenditures, my future family (wife and kids) expenditures.

I can understand where people who long for one party rule, autocracy, military rule come from - their reasoning is probably along the lines of \"let's skip the drama and get on with things, we have stuff to get done\". There's something about it that feels neat, organized, like a well-oiled, precision-engineered, noiseless, frictionless machine where things will \"just happen\" in perpetuity. \n\nIn practice, however, what ends up happening within any system lacking competition, active tug of war, consequences, accountability, is that a parasitic class of people emerges, gets incentivised, and ends up occupying the power hierarchies. They just latch on and get their offspring to latch on as well. Together, they then suck the taxpayers dry. \n\nThere are no consequences because the taxpayers are not a real voting bloc - yet. And won't be for a few decades if we don't grow fast enough. Therefore it becomes easy to bully them with the threat of jailtime, grab money from them and give it away, buy the votes of gullible idiots under random, mostly impromptu \"schemes\".\n\nWe need a clear definition of what a government is, and is not. Where the role and responsibilities of government (centre, state, local, urban, rural) end, and individual responsibility begins. There needs to be a logic and a thoughtfulness to governance. For example, if support of some sort is required, to whom, for how long? What measurable variables do you want to improve to what extent using this support mechanism, beyond which individuals need to become responsible for their lives? How do you incentivise people to get off the support? And all this has to operate under the larger structure of what is financially sustainable. \n\nBecause we can't continue to operate like an impromptu circus, some baraat. Eventually the ride will end, the music will be over, and the bills will have to be paid - it appears that the MP government might not be in a position to pay the bills after all the fancy Innova Crystas they wanna buy with taxpayer money, even though their existing cars are not that old (bought last year) as per this ToI report. \n\nAll this is pretty party-agnostic. This is the default behaviour and mindset of Indian politicians across party lines, with few exceptions. The larger problem is the mental laziness and indiscipline in the culture in general, which stems perhaps from the lack of a unified moral structure that can bind people together?\n\nEven religion, in theory a useful social tool, gets misapplied - people become religious when it comes to faaltu ka halla and partying and drama, and don't use the pretty rich religious-cultural heritage they pretend to be so proud of to actually reflect upon the various aspects of life and society, and use it as a toolbox, set of ideas for structuring their lives. \n\nI don't mean to alarm people here. We *seem* to be moving in the right direction overall, although the movement is a slow, distracted crawl. Threats, parasitical ideas and people lie aplenty, still.  \n\n\n[https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/mp-govt-in-massive-debt-but-ministers-want-new-cars/articleshow/108806844.cms](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/mp-govt-in-massive-debt-but-ministers-want-new-cars/articleshow/108806844.cms)", "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "emojis": [], "location": {"profile_location": null, "geo_location": null, "nlp_location": "Bhopal, India", "final_location": "Bhopal, India", "tier": "Tier-2", "country": "India", "state": null, "city": "Bhopal"}, "sentiment": {"label": "negative", "score": -0.57}, "keywords": ["indian", "politics", "note", "state", "things", "understand"], "aspects": [{"aspect": "performance", "sentiment": "negative", "score": -0.57}, {"aspect": "comfort", "sentiment": "negative", "score": -0.57}, {"aspect": "infotainment", "sentiment": "negative", "score": -0.57}, {"aspect": "price", "sentiment": "negative", "score": -0.57}, {"aspect": "service", "sentiment": "negative", "score": -0.57}], "intent": "query", "embedding": null, "embedding_model": null, "processed_at": "2025-10-03T17:36:37.540776Z", "source_id": "reddit:e69c171d00ce", "target_vehicle": "Toyota Innova", "vehicle_category": "MPV/3-Row"}

The guruji is a homoeopathic doctor (first red flag) & practices in many clinics in Mumbai & Thane.\n\nHis deal is that he claims that he's got enlightenment & can speak to Datta Bhagwan. People come to him for various issues besides health. Marriage problems, property not selling, can't find a partner to marry, family problems, depression, and business problems all are tackled by him. For all these problems he claims to talk to Datta Bhagwan & tells the people to visit some temple & that will solve their problems.\n\nNow keep in mind these temples aren't the typical temple around Mumbai, they're mostly located in South India. Sri Kalahasti, Subramanya, Somnath, Rahu, and Ketu are some of the temples given by him. His main temple is in Gangapur, Karnataka. It's Datta Bhagwan's main place of worship.\n\nComing back to my dad, he was told to visit Gangapur with guruji many times. After going there it helped him out with his alcohol issues so he put his full faith in him & has been taking my family there also & telling everyone who'll listen about the greatness of guruji & the spiritual progress which will happen if you go to Gangapur.\n\nSo with most of the problems that people come for to guruji are ones that get solved eventually with time. What guruji does is he tells the person that they're having this issue because of XYZ planet & their stars aren't correct so they should visit the respective temple to solve their problems.\n\nHe usually tells to make 2-4 trips to these temples depending upon the problem. Now it's very difficult for people who are working or having a business to leave everything & go to these temples. The people who go to him are mostly middle class. So it takes them around 2-3 months to complete all these trips. Problems often resolve within that time & if they don't, guruji just claims that the stars are very bad & you'll have to make more trips.\n\nAnything good that's happening in your life is because you went to these temples & the God's are happy with you. Anything bad happens means you're not doing it with enough faith or he claims that it's this bad because you went to these temples, if you didn't go then it would've been worse.\n\nHe goes to Gangapur almost every weekend with a rented Innova or Tavera. He goes with his wife & sometimes son so he needs to fill his seats in the car so that the contribution per person is less. He'll ask his followers to come with him to Gangapur & they take it as an honour whereas he's just doing it to reduce his cost. Every weekend around 2 cars go to Gangapur.\n\nHe also does trips to temples all across India & does them by car starting from Mumbai. He smokes cigarettes so he always keeps the car non AC. I've travelled so much in those shitty cars for more than 24 hours at a stretch. It was hell. He fits 7 people in a Tavera / Qualis excluding the driver. We made a mattress & plywood the size of the rear seat of the car & we travel often 3 people in the back of the shitty car.\n\nEarlier they were staying in a guest house in Gangapur, later he told his devotees to ask for donations from people for building a math (ashram/guest house with small temples) there. My dad asked everyone he knew for these donations & himself donated a lot & also worked to construct it as he's a civil contractor.\n\nThat sleazy asshole knew my mom's side was rich so he forced my mom to ask her parents to donate.\n\nNow they've built the math there so everyone goes there only. They leave Mumbai on Friday night, reach Gangapur by Saturday morning, rest for the day & usually have havans at night till the morning. The havans were quite normal not some crazy ritual. He frequently tells people to come with their problems to Gangapur as he can't answer them in Mumbai for some reason.\n\nHe isolates you from your friend circle & relatives by saying that if you go & eat from their home, you'll get their bad karma. Don't go to weddings as if they break up in the future, you'll get cursed as you were also a part of it. The only place where you can come to socialize is his dispensary or Gangapur or whatever temple he's going to.\n\nHe has such control over his devotees that they even ask him which car to buy, what mobile to buy, where to go for holidays & the limit of whom they should marry. He just suggests another devotee who's single for their marriage & they do it in Gangapur. His son (he was like my brother till I discovered his father is a con artist) also part of the scam always told me to not tell my friends that I'm going to Gangapur this frequently as he must be aware that someone will take my blinds off.\n\nBut I like my father preached guruji to my close friends. Some of them tried to tell me in a very diplomatic manner that I was being scammed but I didn't take it well. I told them to not dare utter a word about guruji that much was my faith.\n\nEventually, when I was in my smoking up phase in my college hostel, I told those friends also about guruji & his powers. They also tried to tell me I was being robbed showing me examples of Nityananda. I was offended by it & told them 'mera vaala alag hai'. Then one day after I was stoned, I got this sudden realisation that was happening to me & how I was being controlled. Everything made sense & I had a flashback of all the times my friends tried to warn me about him. I broke his rudraksh which was given to me & then decided I'll stop being part of this bullshit.\n\nUnfortunately, this realisation came at a very difficult time in my life. Due to my addiction, I wasn't able to function correctly or even speak coherent sentences, was overthinking as fuck & going in BT. My friends helped me & stood by me all the time but a time came when my condition was so bad that they had to call my parents.\n\nThey told my parents about my addiction & they were shocked to visit my hostel to take me home. At this point, I told them what was happening with us. I showed them a video on Ted-Ed about a cult & paused it to correlate that with what our situation was.\n\nAnother important point, I had started smoking cigarettes & weed because of guruji's son who was my bestie. So I ratted everyone to my parents & told them that when I was going to guruji's place, we were sitting in his son's room & took bong rips. My condition was due to his son. Now I know I should take responsibility for my own actions but at that time I wanted to get my family out of that cult so went with it.\n\nMy mom was very thankful to have me back & she vowed to never go to Gangapur again as it had caused me so much harm. My father & my brother, unfortunately, didn't get convinced & still go to guruji for all the things. My brother even asked guruji what he should do for his birthday! He told him to visit some temple in the south & he did that instead of partying & enjoying his birthday.\n\nI can't understand how such educated people can fall into this trap. Sometimes he literally tells people to kneel & put their head on the floor as we do in temples at a random tile because some god is there & people actually do it!\n\nI want some news agency to expose him for scamming people so that my family & various others can be liberated from his hold. He doesn't have a very big following though. He must be having around 100-200 followers who regularly come to him for advice.\n\nWhat do you guys suggest to expose him? How should I tackle the situation? If I can't take him down, I want to get my family out of it so suggestions are welcome!", "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "emojis": [], "location": {"profile_location": null, "geo_location": null, "nlp_location": "Mumbai, India", "final_location": "Mumbai, India", "tier": "Tier-1", "country": "India", "state": "Maharashtra", "city": "Mumbai"}, "sentiment": {"label": "positive", "score": 0.43}, "keywords": ["serious", "how", "expose", "godman", "who", "running"], "aspects": [{"aspect": "performance", "sentiment": "positive", "score": 0.43}, {"aspect": "comfort", "sentiment": "positive", "score": 0.43}, {"aspect": "price", "sentiment": "positive", "score": 0.43}], "intent": "query", "embedding": null, "embedding_model": null, "processed_at": "2025-10-03T17:36:37.544873Z", "source_id": "reddit:f1ffd680a6ae", "target_vehicle": "Toyota Innova", "vehicle_category": "MPV/3-Row"}

The answer that will bring down the pollution level in Delhi drastically is neither CNG taxis or even odd.  Though CNG taxis can be a sensible option in the sub 2000 cc cabs the long run when  we have increased the CNG stations to 3 times of what they are today.  We will still need non CNG BMWs and Mercs to be there as taxis.  And the cars like Innova as well.  Imagine sending a CNG wagon R to pick up the  CEO of a multi national for a conference.  If someone would analyze the pollution data that will see that the most polluted air in Delhi is at 5 am.  And that is because trucks roam the  roads free all night.  There are no norms for these trucks on pollution.  They spend hours on toll plazas and we cannot have RFID tags mandatory for trucks because each state has to check the goods and we cannot pass the GST that will eliminate this.

I was very excited when AAP announced that it would contest the Delhi Assembly polls. Like many of my friends, my first vote also went to AAP jhadu. Jhadu for change. AAP had its way and I was jubilant.\n\nBut the recent trends Ive seen with this party are quite troubling and have left me disillusioned.\n\nIt has been 10 days since they assumed duties and appointed ministers. Not many  promises are  being fulfilled.\n\n1. Porta cabins for the homeless- Just a promise it seems. It's 10th Jan today, winter is at its peak and is exceptionally harsh this year. Not one has been installed. \n\n2. They said power firms would be audited and whatever excesses they were charging would be revised. But instead they chose the easy way- provided subsidy. Now it is a truth that states suck at power distribution and try to keep away from it. Subsidy on power for domestic use is a big no-no globally. USSR collapsed, China learnt it lesson. Delhi's finances will be crippled. Power cuts upto 2hrs have begun occurring frequently in parts of the city. \n\n3. The 700l that was promised reached to only 4L or so families. If anyone bother to look at DJB water tariff rates, they will see that the cost for those 700l daily were very nominal to say the least. [here are the rates mentioned on DJB site](http://www.delhijalboard.nic.in/djbdocs/whats_new/press/releases/calculation%20of%20water%20bill.htm)\nMoreover, out of the 17000000 people in delhi, only 3% will benefit.\n\n4. All AAP members vowed to lead austere lives- in a bid to end the VIP culture- but this was not observed either. They all accepted their swanky Innovas. Remember how they mad enews by travelling in metro on the swearing in day?\n\n5. In a bid to avoid uncomfortable decisions regarding the slums on public land, AAP had promised not one slum will be removed till they are provided with alternate housing. Providing for so many people will never be practical. And the slums will only swell in an unregulated manner. And FYI, most of the slum plots are owned by a few people and they reap all the slum rents. Its another mafia lurking in there.\n\n6. AAP is yet to make a manifesto regarding anything apart from corruption. But it has decided on pushing for more reservations based on caste and gender. [Link to Econ Times](http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2014-01-06/news/45918537_1_aap-aam-aadmi-party-additional-quota) This seems bad, atleast to me.\n\n7. Their stand on Nuclear Power is unclear. But they seem to be leaning against it. But Nuclear power is the way forward. Isnt it?\n\n8. Some people pointed out on TV that AAP is going to be an elitist party. Many the bigwigs from the industries who have achieved a lot in their profession are now thinking of jumping into politics with AAP tickets. But what is wrong is that these people have done naught for the society and are not really connected to the grassroots.\n\nOne might say that this big an article was written surely by some anti AAP person with much time to spare.

Floods wreck havoc in Bihar - Why can't 'Modi save 15,000' like he did in Uttarakhand in 2013?\n\nWe all clearly remember how stories overflowing with machismo, bravado were floating around in 2013 when Uttarakhand was struck with floods, landslides.\n\nBack in those last days of 'corrupt, maun-mohan ki sarkar', a gentleman from Gujarat was ubiquitous. He was seen in SRCC Delhi speaking on Economics & challenges ahead for India, in Chandigarh discussing 'IIT problems' with army wives & their kids & heck, he event suggested how India can win '8-10 Olympic medal' by 'Mapping army jawans who have 'रुचि' / Interest in sports or खेलने कूदने.\n\nIn one of those days, this ubiquitous gentleman apparently saved '15,000' stranded pilgrims from tough flooded territory, apparently dived into scene with Volvos and innovas and saved thousands of pilgrims while our own 'incompetent' army could rescue 1200-1500 people a day (24*7 operation were on).\n\nIn the age of whatsApp & 400 news channels, Indians 'consume' news all day. In few hours, this gentleman was a hero, a superman except he didn't wear a cape or laal chaddi on top of his pyjama. Women wanted their husband's to ape this gentleman, Mother's wanted their son's to be like this gentleman, a new hindu hriday samrat was born. A man who could do wonders with NO external support, NO logistics or relief operation - He could dash in with innovas and save 15THOUSAND People. In the age of meek maun mohan, orgasming Indians had found their next way to salvation.\n\nEXCEPT: This gentleman was a fraud, he never saved 15,000 people, he never solved IIT problems, he never even 'mapped army jawan to their interest to 8-10 medals' can be won. He was adept at planting stories, creating perceptions, promising Utopia.\n\nIt's like, someone announces in public - 'Hey you know, Amit Shah is a goat fucker' Sometime later the goat in discussion clarifies in public - 'Hang on guys, Amit shah never fucked me'. Irrespective of clarification from alleged victim, the taint never goes off, the perception stays intact - Amit will permenently will remebered as someone 'who fucked a goat, na?'\n\nThis is what Modi has been doing to ascend to power. \n\nhttp://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/narendra-modi-lands-in-uttarakhand-flies-out-with-15000-gujaratis/articleshow/20724044.cms\n\nIndia is facing multiple natural calamities at the moment -\n\nBihar - http://www.firstpost.com/india/heavy-rains-in-nepal-cause-floods-in-bihar-nitish-kumar-calls-high-level-meeting-to-assess-situation-3927485.html\n\nHimachal - http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/monster-landslip-in-himachal-buries-vehicles-50-dead/articleshow/60050767.cms\n\nI never see stories like Modi dashing and saving 15,000 being planted again.", "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "emojis": [], "location": {"profile_location": null, "geo_location": null, "nlp_location": "Delhi, India", "final_location": "Delhi, India", "tier": "Tier-1", "country": "India", "state": "Delhi", "city": "Delhi"}, "sentiment": {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.0}, "keywords": ["floods", "wreck", "havoc", "bihar", "why", "modi"], "aspects": [{"aspect": "performance", "sentiment": "neutral", "score": 0.0}, {"aspect": "service", "sentiment": "neutral", "score": 0.0}], "intent": "query", "embedding": null, "embedding_model": null, "processed_at": "2025-10-03T17:36:37.549745Z", "source_id": "reddit:396cc9a0c31f", "target_vehicle": "Toyota Innova", "vehicle_category": "MPV/3-Row"}

Should be a decent buy if I can find a good example. \n\n* Renault Duster. Not the largest car and certainly not my favorite, but I have to say that the car is not bad at all. \n\n* VW Vento.

They are so incompetent and their innovation is dogshit. I can't think of a single major innovation coming out of these companies and they take such a high place in Indian minds. The only reason they survive is because of artificial low competition from foreign companies (enormous import duties, etc.). Nobody is bringing their best products to India anymore. Let's look at automobile sector for a proof:\n\n1. Ford left\n2. Fiat left\n3. Suzuki don't sell their best cars here\n4. Toyota gave up - they are just reselling Maruti now\n5. Honda trimmed down its offering\n\nThe \"industry leaders\" destroy local ecosystem by discouraging scientific approach to design and manufacturing. It's so hard to build a global quality product from India. I'll give you examples:\n\n1. Try to find something specialised like \"High temperature paint\" or [tube fittings made to an established standard](https://products.swagelok.com/en/fittings/c/100), you find very few options.\n2. Poor craftsmanship culture. I frequently get wrong angles and lengths even when I hire someone with a CNC.\n3. Poor tools - hundreds of times I couldn't find the right tools I needed to build something I wanted.\n4. Poor financing - it's only open to the already rich never to someone just talented.\n\nIn most other countries, the big companies actively improve the ecosystem by **developing standards,**  training the local talent, promoting a **rational thought** to solving problems, opening their infrastructure to startups and above all by **not funding idiots to power**. Narayanamurthy tells youth to work 16 hours. That is equivalent to saying, \"Work harder not smarter\".\n\nSo much incompetence - why is it ok for a person to run an electrical parts shop knowing nothing about electrical parts? I once asked a shop owner for 16A plug, he pointed to me 250V rating and said this means it will work for 16A too. This shop was literally in the industrial area in that city. It takes literally 1 second to see that what I'm talking about is not what's written there.\n\nWe are bleeding the last good people. We missed the automobile revolution, we'll miss the electric revolution too. Why do we not point out how dumb and idiotic our \"industry leaders\" are?

First and foremost, let me clarify that this isn’t about any specific political party which may be in power in any state or the center. I’d some family members working in the central government earlier, and this is a trend that I’ve been observing since the early 2000’s. Previously, government vehicles would exclusively be either HM Ambassadors, or Tata SUVs for those who had field assignments, and the Maruti Suzuki Gypsy for police/military. However, in the 2000s, I saw these vehicles being replaced with Mitsubishi Lancers, Maruti Suzuki Esteems & SX4s, Toyota Corollas, Camrys, Innovas & Qualys , Honda Citys and Accords, and Mahindra Boleros. The point being that while we still had Indian brands in the mix, we had a lot more foreign brands, and that’s partly understandable because the car market had been liberalized since the 90s, and maybe around this time the older vehicles needed to be replaced.\n\nHowever, at the same time, I’ve observed in America that the governments (city/state/federal) exclusively use vehicles built by American manufacturers (Ford/Dodge/GM). For those who know even the US President uses a GM made Cadillac (customized of course). On the contrary, the Indian President and PM use customized a BMW and Mercedes.\n\nCould this be purely symbolic - maybe coz these American brands don’t exclusively build all their North American cars in the US, and have factories outside the US as well. But at the same time, they still do have a lot of factories in the US (some maybe closing as we speak, but that’s a different topic) which create American jobs.\n\nSo, the question is why don’t the Indian governments (at all levels) push for a similar drive? I think regardless of party politics, every party is on board with Make-In-India/Buy-In-India, and if new factories come during their reigns which create more jobs, they can take credit for generating more jobs.", "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "emojis": [], "location": {"profile_location": null, "geo_location": null, "nlp_location": null, "final_location": null, "tier": null, "country": "India", "state": null, "city": null}, "sentiment": {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.0}, "keywords": ["why", "indian", "state", "central", "governments", "not"], "aspects": [{"aspect": "performance", "sentiment": "neutral", "score": 0.0}], "intent": "query", "embedding": null, "embedding_model": null, "processed_at": "2025-10-03T17:36:37.553949Z", "source_id": "reddit:665db3fd511c", "target_vehicle": "Toyota Innova", "vehicle_category": "MPV/3-Row"}

**Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System (IRNSS)** recently become fully-operational and has been provided with the operational name of **NavIC (Navigation with Indian Constellation)**. Developed by the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) with the objective of offering **positioning, navigation and timing (PNT)** to the users on a variety of platforms with a **24 hour x 7 day service availability under all weather conditions** \\- in its service area with a position accuracy of < 20 m throughout India and within the region of coverage extending about 1500 km beyond. [^(nih.gov)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5336083/)\n\nHaving an **autonomous regional satellite navigation system of one’s own offers strategic autonomy in military operations.** The GPS that we have known and used all along is the satellite-based radio navigation system owned by the US government and operated by the American Air Force.

US banks on atmospheric model to assess frequency error and it has to update this model from time to time to assess the exact error. In India's case, the actual delay is assessed by measuring the difference in delay of dual frequency (S and L bands). Therefore, **NavIC is not dependent on any model to find the frequency error and is more accurate than GPS**.

As the title suggests, I'm kinda fed up with my parents. They seriously need therapy.\n\n I'll start with my mom. She's actually really selfish. Since childhood, I was never allowed to go out and play with other kids. She says that I am allergic to dust and that she'll have to clean my clothes which are full of dust. I ignored her and played out few times but eventually gave in. I got immersed in mobile and the internet. I was never let alone to go out and explore like my neighbour kids. They used to hang out the entire day and ride their bicycle across the neighbourhood and to town. She restricted me to ride the cycle within my house premises. Then she never allows or gives me privacy. She always intrudes me while I'm bathing, changing clothes etc. The main reason is she treats me like a child. She tells me to do this, do that, wear this dress. That's not a big issue as far as I'm concerned. But whenever I tell her Im going outside, she takes the clothes including my inner wear from the cupboard even though I tell her I can do it myself. I think she has some disorder that makes her think she will lose authority of the house and authority over me if I start being independent. She loves when I ask her for help. And she advices me for 10-15 mins if I do the same. She does not allow me to iron my own clothes, enter the kitchen and do the dishes, prepare tea or anything that makes me independent. When I was installing my PC in my room, she interfered and said that the PC should be installed in the hall because apparently the Internet cable will have to be longer. I still don't understand that. I think she does not want me to have privacy. She also doesn't like when I lock my doors. So basically she made me a useless, dependant, introvert kid. I have done several attempts during childhood to break away from her control. I even went out to play with kids for 1 week when I was 11 or 12 but apparently my brother got injured when another kid accidentally rode the bike over his leg which was a minor case. She held on to it and permanently banned me from going outside. Whenever guests come to the house, she gets out from the back of the house and talks and deals with them outside the house itself. She rarely let's guests in. She hates when I say I'm inviting a friend to the house. She reasons with me that \"The house will have dust and dirt if he comes to the house\". Also, whenever we come home, she forces me to scrub the legs hard for the dirt or something to come off and wash our legs with soap before entering the house. WTF logic is that? We are going to bath anyways so why do that? Because of that she installed a outdoor bathroom/shower which is a small cube like thing outside our house. Also, she doesn't allow me to shift table fans, tables or anything from one place to another. My dad once did so and she screamed and shouted and she slammed her head in the wall herself as if in a sign of protest(I felt really bad and ashamed that day). My room actually has an AC which I don't want to turn on during racing season but she stops me from turning on the fan during that time and forces me to sleep with AC on. She's saying that when fan turns on, there will be dust in the room. I'm really stuck now. I can't go out, can't move things in my own room, I can't invite friends, My relatives and cousins don't come to my home because my mother will not let them in. Whenever I see my relatives and cousins they ask me \"Why are you not going out of the house or letting us into your house?\". I don't have an answer and it destroys my self confidence. I told her a lot of times to see a doctor but she psychiatrist but she won't. Whenever I'm in school hostel, I feel like it is the real me. I joke around, have fun, talk a lot but when I'm at home, I feel like a different person. I don't feel comfortable laughing, joking or going outside. The main reason is her. My MOM. I still get nightmares thinking if my friend asks to come to my home. I get real anxiety if they come to my home. I fear that they might dislike my mom's outrageous behaviour. Also I fear they will dislike me because I do not go out of the house and be independent. I fear that they will know that I do not have friends outside my school Circle (which the main reason is my mom). She also occassionally swears at me. Calls me bad words and curses at my dad. My biggest dream now is to escape this hellhole of a home and live in some hostel or room.\n\nNow my dad. He is the biggest gambler ever. Not literally but I'll explain. He was born in a poor farmer family but he did a diploma and started working in Dubai. He earned a good amount every month and he built our house. But he got his biggest opportunity in Oman where he was offered ₹1.25L/month salary + Free apartment + Free transport + Free food + Subsidised School for me. He took the offer and we moved there. But after 1 year, he did a dumb thing. He took a loan of ₹50L and started a hotel business without even having any business experience. He employed 10-15 people before the business even started. The business was a huge failure and he lost the money. Meanwhile his company also found this out and kicked him out. I studied 1 year there in a good school but had to leave because of him. He lost ₹50L + Our livelihood in Oman. We came back to India and he got another job in UAE paying ₹2L/month but quit that too because his boss was upset at him at work. Then he got another job in Kazakhstan paying ₹3L/month but quit that too because of his laziness. He always believed he is born to do business. He kept saying he will because a multi-millionare within a year. He kept quitting jobs and now he worked in India itself for ₹30k/month. He then started a milk business which failed and he lost ₹1L. Now he started another Tyre business which is now running at loss. He also has a habit of spending money aimlessly. He buys random expensive clothes, shoes, phones, TV, Expensive chairs etc. He lost all his money on all of these. He does not have a sense of fear over financial ruin. He is now telling me that he'll sell our inherited land and buy a Innova Crysta. I have no words. \n\nThe only way we still are not bankrupt is my mothers small rental unit that gives us ₹20-30k/month. There is a lot more to say about my relatives. But that's whole another lesson. Any advice on what I should do? I have done everything in my power to make them right. \n\n(Sorry for rant. Didn't intend this to be so long)\n\nTLDR : My parents are insufferable. What can I do to fix it?\n\n(I just passed out of school, so moving out is not an option.

I'm a sophomore in college.\n\nMy parents will be paying for the car, and I'll be paying for its maintenance through my rather generous allowance and a part time job.

I only have experience driving a [Honda City](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda_City#Fourth_generation_.282002.E2.80.932008.29), [Toyota Rush](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_Rush#Second_generation), [Nissan Sylphy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nissan_Bluebird_Sylphy#Second_generation_.28G11.3B_2005.E2.80.932012.29) and [Toyota Innova](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_Innova) none of which exist where I live now in Texas.\n\nI would be using the car to commute about 15-20 minutes every morning and again at night to college on a daily basis, as well as simply driving around to get to places. I'm looking for a car that's comfortable and practical to drive. I'm also used to driving stick, and I would like to know if any of you have anything to say about buying cars with manual transmission - is it worth the investment? Is the better gas mileage significant?\n\nRight now I'm looking at cars like a Honda Accord, Nissan Altima, Mazda6, but I'm willing to listen to any piece of advice you can give me.

I owned a 2019 Tesla Model 3 Performance for roughly two years and 15,000 miles. I'm going to distill my key learnings and experiences here, in an attempt to educate others on EVs and reach some form of closure. My ownership could best be summed-up as a love/hate relationship, ending with crazy used car values offering me the out I'd been quietly seeking. Clearly, I decided EVs aren't for me - at least, not yet. I'm not a \"paid big oil shill\" or someone who's trying to short the stock, as I'm sure some of the Tesla nuts will claim. I'm just a car enthusiast (disclaimer: not an engineer) standing at the same crossroads as the rest of you, wondering what sounds future children will make long after (if?) our beloved bureaucrats outlaw the ICE.\n\nEverything I'm writing here is based on my own unique tastes and preferences. How the pros and cons balance out at the end is entirely up to you. And that's fine. Choice is great. Note that this post centers on Battery EVs (BEVs) at the time of this writing, which comprise the vast majority of EVs on the road today.\n\nAnd yeah. This got way longer than I anticipated. But it was cathartic for me and I hope it's at least somewhat useful to someone out there.\n\n# EV performance & its accessibility\n\nI'll start with what ultimately sold me on the car - **Immense, instant power.** The war in the \"pure acceleration\" category is pretty much over - just take a look at Jason Cammisa's video with the Model S Plaid vs. the BMW M5 CS and Cadillac Crazy. They're not even on the same planet. Not only is the acceleration brutal, but it's consistent (everything else held constant - more on that later). Look up any number of 0 - 60 videos on YouTube, and you'll notice that the times are all remarkably close, especially if there are multiple runs in the same video.\n\nAnd how could they not be? Software and traction control are fundamental to EV operation. Adjustments take mere milliseconds. The amount of \"stuff\" involved between your right foot and the tires is a joke compared to an ICE car. And it's basically idiot-proof - even with the Track Mode dialed to 100% hoon in my TM3P, it was nearly impossible to make a mistake. You just put your foot down and the car takes care of the rest, with literally zero drama.\n\n# Electric motors are great\n\nAnd all of this performance comes with no mechanical sympathy. I never felt an ounce of it, flogging my Model 3 - there's really nothing to \"break\" mechanically in the way of the drivetrain. The entire drive unit consists of the motor, a few gears, the diff, a pump to circulate the oil... and that's really about it. No fried clutches, exploding transmissions, shredded differentials, etc... it's always ready to pounce at any speed, in any situation. Electric motors themselves are relatively inexpensive, quiet, clean, tough, extremely efficient, insanely long-lasting, and have an excellent power/size ratio. When it comes to to the task of turning energy into mechanical force, I'm not sure there's anything better.\n\nAND! You don't even have to worry about getting the motors up to operating temperature before you get on it. During the colder months, it easily takes 10+ minutes of highway driving for the oil of an ICE to warm up (you are looking at your oil and not the coolant temp, right?). I quite enjoyed leaving my neighborhood with the ability to give it full \"throttle\" right out of the gate. It's like teleporting straight into any 3-car gap, no matter where. (But there are limitations to this - more on that later, too.)\n\n# Convenience & running costs\n\nYou can also have your cake and eat it, too! There's no need to feel like a moron with a 550 HP ICE engine idling under the hood in daily stop and go traffic. My TM3P was an efficient, calm, quiet, easy, comfortable way of getting from Point A to Point B while being more similar performance-wise to a BMW M3 than a Toyota Corolla - with fewer running costs than either. True, the suspension, brakes, thermal management gubbins, etc., are largely synonymous between an EV and ICE. But when it comes to the actual propulsion, there's basically zero wear and tear. Just a dumb motor that doesn't care about much, and will probably last well past 1 million miles. With a new battery, you're basically looking at a brand-new drivetrain.\n\nAnd yes, running on electricity is cheaper than filling up an ICE car - this is where most of the EV \"savings\" materialize. In my experience, electricity in the mid-Atlantic region cost roughly 12¢/kWh and 9¢/kWh in the PNW. For my TM3P, that equates to about $10 and $8 in each region, respectively, to travel \\~265 miles, assuming: A 75 kWh battery pack, lifetime consumption average of 280 Wh/mile, and a 13% charging loss, **IF** you can charge at home (which is key to the \"get in and go\" convenience of an EV - without that, forget it). Subtract oil + filter changes, spark plugs, failing chain tensioners, bad oxygen sensors, burnt out cat converters, and other annoying problems, and the running costs quickly stack up in the EV's favor. You rarely even use the brakes! Even with the initial purchase price of an EV still being notably higher than gasoline, on average, you can make the argument that it still comes out cheaper in the long run. But the wildcard here is \"how long is 'long run?'\"\n\nThe cost of battery pack replacement isn't discussed as often as I'd like. Some of the earliest Model S packs are already starting to fail - only about 10 years later. When I sold my E46, it was approaching 20 years old. It still faithfully serves its new owner on a daily basis, today. Maybe I've only heard about the edge cases, and the Model 3's will all last considerably last longer, but I personally never got comfortable being part of a beta test. The batteries in these cars remain a delicate subject, which brings us to the poo-poo part of this post.\n\n# Let's face it - batteries still suck.\n\nElectric motors are one thing; powering them is an entirely different story. Conventional lithium-ion batteries are really the only currently viable way to power EVs en masse. Part of what makes them great is that they're extremely efficient when it comes to storing and dispensing energy - especially compared to fossil fuels and other solutions in the works. You put electricity in, electricity comes back out. The leap from energy generation to use is extremely short. But they do have notable limitations around longevity, performance, and cost, especially when it comes to shuffling a 2+ ton vehicle around. Whether you're willing to accept these limitations is up to you.\n\n**Degradation is inevitable**\n\nAt this point, the oldest Model Ss on the road at about 10 years old. Although the Model 3 pack is newer and has less cells (thus less to go wrong - 7,920 in the Plaid vs 4,416 in a TM3 LR), we don't yet have enough information to truly know what to expect from these packs from a longevity perspective. Unlikely that Tesla will ever share this info, either. If Elon is to be believed, the Model 3 pack should last 300,000 - 500,000 miles. If Elon is to be believed, fully-autonomous cars would've been shuffling us around long before 2020. We know that with proper care, pretty much any modern ICE car should be able to surpass the 250,000 mile mark without many problems. So anyone who likes to run their cars for as long as possible and buys an EV should know that they're venturing into the unknown.\n\nYes, I'm aware that there are examples out there of Model Ss surpassing several hundred thousand miles - with the caveat being that a not-insignificant number of them of them involved battery and/or drive unit replacements at various points. There are also Hyundai Elantras out there with 1,000,000+ miles on their original powertrains.\n\nBut note that degradation is only one part of the story. Upon my departure of Tesland, I can't recall hearing of anyone replacing packs due to natural degradation. All the replacement stories I came across were pack failures in one form or another. Yes, the internet is a fantastic place for angry people to vent, and it could be that the population's negatively skewed - like the Finnish guy who recently blew up his Model S on YouTube. But the reality is that if one single cell - not brick, not module, but **cell** \\- fails, the pack is done. That cell turns into a parasite. The car will struggle and ultimately fail to balance out the pack, eventually giving up one morning, telling you to GFY, and to take it to Tesla. Last I heard, replacing the battery on a Model S was \\~$24,000 and \\~$16,000 for a Model 3. This is just one type of sudden pack failure that I've heard about, and what makes it especially concerning is that the root cause seems fairly trivial relative to the catastrophe that ensues. Maybe it's overblown and maybe I'm being paranoid, but the chances of this happening are real, and only increase in with age...\n\n...which is something else that affects battery degradation, as indicated by Tesla's latest shenanigan of selling \"new\" cars with batteries from 4+ year-old stock, claiming that range \"may be reduced by 12%.\" (At the time of this writing: Model 3 SR drive unit + battery warranty is 8 years/100,000 miles, LR is 8 years/120,000 miles). So yes, the car is literally getting worse every day by the sheer virtue of just sitting there - especially in extreme climates. How pronounced is the impact of age vs. use vs. fast-charging is anybody's guess, but it's a reality that needs to be acknowledged.\n\nSo if you're comfortable with basically ending up with a 2 - 3 ton paperweight if some electrical fault appears in the pack, and have the means to shovel cash into the Tesla furnace without much concern for what the future may hold, then you're probably less worried about the battery. I envy your fortitude and tolerance for risk - it's something I thought I could swallow, but couldn't. As I learned these realities, I became increasingly less comfortable with the prospect of keeping the car past its warranty period. Yes, an ICE can also fail (a timeworn Tesla fanatic argument), but not many ICE failures end in the car being completely inoperable - especially in modern cars which are ridiculously reliable and serviceable by anyone.\n\n**Mitigation means sacrifice**\n\nIf you want the battery to last as long as possible, you have to be nice to it.\n\nYou don't want to leave the battery fully-charged for extended periods of time, or let it drop below 10% - there are arguments that doing either of these is more detrimental to battery longevity than supercharging. But this is why the 90 - 100% block on a Tesla's charge indicator is labeled \"Trip.\" (I don't think any other manufacturers do this... And part of me wonders whether it's a Teslan strategy to maximize rated range.) So right off the batt (ha), you're 20% down if you're concerned for battery health. It's OK to charge to 100% right before a long trip, but the lower, the better, around town. There are people who charge to 90%, 80%, or even lower on a daily basis as a result. Jeff Dahn recommends 70% to maximize life - you can look him up. Now, paying $50K+ for a vehicle like this and running it below its potential for most of its life just... sucks. Especially seeing as the car produces its maximum power output only at about 90%+ state of charge (SoC).\n\nThat's right. Until they develop a battery that behaves like it's filled with a liquid, this is going to remain a reality. Batteries are only at their best when they're charged to 90 - 100% of their capacity. This becomes especially noticeable at highway speeds at a low SoC, since EVs accelerate far more brutally from a stop than from a roll. The car is still **plenty** quick on the highway, but this does result in some ass-clenching moments when passing cars on a divided yellow and you're used to driving around in God Mode. You put your foot down at <30% SoC @ 55 mph, expecting one response, but get quite another. (Disclaimer: Although this is a battery reality, it's also a byproduct of the car having a single gear - no motor can rev to infinity.)\n\nBatteries also do *not* like extreme temperature. Batteries are like people - they're most comfortable at the temperatures we're most comfortable - right around 70°F. This impacts **both** their output and charging. So in the cold, they do not want to charge, and they do not want to give you full power. When it's *extremely* cold, expect to lose 30 - 40% of your range thanks to this convenient little truth, combined with the fact that you're probably running the heat. In lower temperatures, my Model 3's \"acceleration/regen\" indicator frequently told me that the car was both power-limited and/or regen-limited because of a cold-soaked battery. What does \"cold\" mean? I don't know - and seems to change with software updates. Towards the end of my ownership, it seemed that the car sitting overnight in the high 40s/low 50s was enough to result in power limiting to protect the battery. Preheating the car before departure mitigates this problem, which eats into your range unless you're plugged in. (Note that Tesla also recently updated the Model 3 with a heat pump vs. a resistive heater, which sounds like it's notably helped with cold weather driving range. However, initial accounts of how this affects cold weather power output were mixed, as cabin HVAC and battery were both effectively \"competing\" for scavenging what little heat was available. Whether or not these problems have since been remedied, I'm not sure.)\n\n**Performance (with caveats)**\n\nExcessive heat also presents problems. Since an ICE vehicle's engine is operating at about 212°F, the ambient temperature differential is generally more than enough to provide cooling. Even temps of 100°F+ provide plenty of space to act as a sink. But when \"hot\" is closer to \\~120°F, as in for a Li-ion battery, things get a bit more challenging. Obviously this won't be a relevant problem for 99.98% of people, but it is an issue if you're planning on sustained high-performance driving. I think the problem is \\*almost\\* solved through aftermarket components like larger radiators and auxiliary cooling pumps, but as of my leaving the community a number of months ago, it was still an issue for the Model 3, even in cooler temperatures. (Whether they've solved this with the Plaid, I'm not sure - I don't know if anyone's been able to run it for long enough prior to overcooking the horribly insufficient brakes and/or tires.) And if you are planning on tracking your Model 3, anticipate something like <60 miles of track driving range because of an EV's sensitivity to stress, and the simple fact that the car isn't really carrying that much energy on board.\n\nLook up Jason Fenske's Engineering Explained video on battery density on YouTube for an excellent explanation of this. It boils down to the fact that a gallon of gasoline has roughly 13x the energy density than the best of modern Li-ion batteries by volume - and we're strictly talking about the cells here. I.e., it doesn't take into account the fact that there are a lot of other things that need to surround those cells to get them to actually do their job in an EV. The battery pack in a Long Range Model 3 weighs roughly 1,000 lbs... All of the energy contained within equates to roughly 2.2 gallons of gasoline. Which also has the added benefit of being extremely portable, should you find yourself off the beaten path. Try carrying that much energy in batteries by hand... Hope you brought a spare car.\n\nBut that's not the entire story. Yes, EVs do put more of that energy into forward motion than an ICE. But this excellent efficiency is also precisely the reason why EV racing isn't going to approach the length of conventional races any time soon. I'm too dumb to explain it in mathematical terms, but since EVs are so efficient, every \"stressor\" they experience has a disproportionate impact on their range vs. a similar ICE vehicle. The best ICE engines on the road today are something like 35 - 40% efficient, which means that 60 - 65% of the energy in the fuel is basically wasted as heat vs. propulsion. So any kind of \"fast\" or aggressive driving is going to have an exponential impact on an EV's range.\n\nI *never* saw the quoted \"310 miles of range\" that's on the sticker of the Model 3 - and this was on the standard, hateful 18\" MXM4s that came with the car. At one point I ran into a former colleague at my local Tesla service center who was there to discuss that very issue - \"I'm not getting 300+ miles on the highway?\" Yep. The girl at the counter told him the same thing. \"That's normal - anything above 70 MPH is going to dramatically decrease your range.\" If you look on the forums, generally speaking, the lifetime average consumption that many people are getting hovers around 280 Wh/mile. If you drive like a nance, this number will obviously improve, but if you're on this forum... I'm guessing you drive a bit more spiritedly than that.\n\nTo accommodate said spirited driving, I decided to up the car's OEM 235 tires (that's what the new Civic SI comes with, except it's 1,200 lbs lighter) to 265 PS4Ss and installed a set of KW coilovers. As a result of the aforementioned sensitivity, I knew my range would take a hit... but I wasn't quite prepared for how much. One morning while taking my wife to the airport, I said \"ok, I'm just going to drive this like I used to drive the BMW.\" Temps were in the upper 40s/lower 50s, heated seats on, cabin heat on low, averaging 70-ish mph on the highway with one passenger + her luggage. On return, I calculated that my range would've come out to roughly **200 miles.** As many Tesla evangelists would argue, \"well, dass enuff range\" and sure, in most situations, that's probably true. But for me, personally, this added another layer of  anxiety that made any form of enthusiastic driving feel like a sin. There are rumors out there that the Model 3 was literally designed around the wheels and tires, and after experiencing that, I'm inclined to believe it.\n\nSo when people talk about using EVs to tow over extended distances, I'm not exactly sure how that's gonna fly. Especially with heavy/large loads, and considering that such vehicles will need charging stations spacious enough to accommodate them on long-haul trips. And I don't care about this \"o well X% of people don't tow past Y miles.\" I just don't. EV forums are filled with tiresome \"oh you don't need that\" arguments that are somehow supposed to enshroud the fact that for many people, an EV would result in a step backwards when it comes to utility. Anyway, that brings us to everyone's favorite subject - charging infrastructure!\n\n# Do you have a place to charge?\n\nAt the time of this writing, you're kidding yourself if you think that there's any other viable EV option besides a Tesla. And this is assuming you're sticking to generally well-traveled paths in fair-weather conditions. That's because when you buy a Tesla, you're also buying into their supercharger network. The whole experience is generally pretty good - you simply drive up to the charger, plug in your car, and that's it. (Admittedly, I don't have experience with any other EV fast charging, but from what I've heard and seen, it's spotty, at best.)\n\nWhen you go off the beaten path, that's when things get a little dicey. Every time we went somewhere a little \"unique,\" I'd have to carefully think about what type of range I could expect given the weather conditions and if it was realistic to make a round-trip without buggin'. Expect your \"real\" range in a big-battery Model 3 to be more like \\~250 miles on the OEM wheels and tires in good weather. It's true that the car will most likely beat 310 miles in city driving, where EV range is amazing, but that's quite a narrow use case that would take literally all day. Then again, I never actually heard of anyone \"running out of battery\" on the road (in which case your only recourse is to tow the car), but it is a little uncomfortable to read about various close calls, like people trying to keep their families from freezing to death in 10°F weather with the heater sucking down 3 kW, sitting in 3+ hours of traffic. The car does its damndest to keep you from running out, though, triggering warnings to reduce your speed or telling you that you're driving into a \"supercharger desert\" if it calculates that you're living on the edge.\n\nSo if you do end up traveling into a supercharger desert, with only third-party and destination chargers to rely on, you have to be prepared to ask yourself several questions:\n\n1. Is there charging?\n2. Is it accessible to you? Or is it purely for clients of an establishment, etc.?\n3. Is it compatible? Different standards *do* exist, which is genuinely infuriating if we're gonna get serious about electrified personal transport. This isn't a fucking cellphone. As far as I know, third-party fast charging for Teslas is either sketchy at the moment, or nowhere near as powerful as a 150+ kW supercharger. (By the way, melting a J1772 adapter for a Tesla at any third-party chargers is not uncommon. Ask me how I know.)\n4. Is it powerful enough to get you the range you need in the time you have to charge?\n5. Are you willing to pay the price? A lot of these places are no longer free. Some cost a ridiculous amount for simple Level 2 charging, which is basically like someone asking you to pay for using a dryer outlet.\n6. Is it even going to be available? If it's open parking or it's saturated with other EVs, you might have to wait. If it's Level 2, you're probably doomed.\n\nOnly if you can answer \"Yes\" to those with confidence are you good-to-go. And while it's true that the \"gas savings\" are real, many people don't seem to be factoring in the charging losses I mentioned earlier. Estimate 10 - 15% losses for charging, meaning that you're consuming more electricity than what actually makes it into the pack. These charging losses get worse in extreme temperatures - up to 40% in cold weather. You still come out ahead, but it's an important fact to note if we're going to be honest with ourselves. And the assumption underpinning that argument is always that you are charging at home - a reality that only exists for something like 40% of the American driving public. Charging at a supercharger costs more.\n\nEven if fast-charging the battery wasn't detrimental to its health, it's not like there's a supercharging station on every corner. Building superchargers costs a lot of money, it's not as simple as just \"tapping into the local supercharger line.\" You'll notice that at every station, there's huge enclosed devices turning massive amounts of electricity into DC power. I've heard that Tesla doesn't run these as profit centers, and I do think the pricing to supercharge is very reasonable, but it's still not free (unless you get this incentive) - so charging at a supercharger costs roughly the same in \"fuel\" as driving an econobox.\n\nAnd as batteries continue getting better and better, as they will, keep in mind that a kWh of energy is a kWh of energy. A theoretical 1 MW pack in a theoretical Tesla semi is going to need a supercharger that outputs about 4x the power of today's fastest superchargers to get to where it's going in any reasonable amount of time. If we imagine some super magic battery that's 50 MW and weighs 1 ton, it's not like you'll be able to charge that on a dryer outlet. You need serious power infrastructure on the other side of that battery to make it practical. I'd imagine that powering sustained commercial flight someday, for example, would basically require airports build their own dedicated power plants. Admittedly I have no clue how difficult or easy this is, but I'm sure there's an army of electrical engineers frothing at the keyboard to add to this point.\n\n# From an enthusiast's perspective...\n\nI've already scratched the surface of this, but I'd like to take a moment to talk about my TM3P strictly from an enthusiast's standpoint. There's a lot of stereotypes out there about Tesla owners, and while it is true that many of them have never seen a flathead screwdriver, there's also a substantial number of them coming from high-performance BMWs, Porsche 911s, Dodge Hellcats, McLarens, etc. A good number of them claim that the TM3P is the \"most fun\" car they've ever owned, and that's great, but I guess fun means different things to different people.\n\nI genuinely feel like two years of driving this car has made me a dumber and less engaged driver. I can't quite put my finger on the root of it - I think it's some combination of no noise, no gears, not using the brakes 98% of the time, and the experience of owning a car that basically does everything for you. For most people, unfortunately, that's probably exactly what they want... but not me. I want to be involved. For most of my life, given the cars I've owned, the journey's always at least been *some* part of the reward. And with the Tesla, I can't say that I ever really \"looked forward\" to driving it. It was  such a seamless and uninvolving experience that it just kind of faded into the background as a simple means to an end, rather than something engaging and fun to look forward to.\n\nAnd it's not for lack of capability. With coilovers, sways, various control arms, and wheels + tires, my TM3P was razor sharp and scary quick in any given situation. At auto-xs, I was able to hang with seasoned veterans driving Cayman GT4s equipped with track tires. But even then, as I was getting thrown about the cabin on the sofa-like seat (seriously - most comfortable seats of any car I've ever driven), I couldn't help but feel that something was still missing, and it runs deeper than the difference between \"fun\" and \"exciting.\"\n\nI don't think it's necessarily down to the fact that I grew up driving with both hands and both feet. A while ago I got a Hyundai Kona AWD as a rental. I had a ton of fun throwing that thing around... maybe more fun than I'd ever had in my Tesla. (As Jeremy Clarkson says - the fastest car in the world is the rental car.) Coming to this tragic realization was a big red flag for me. Maybe it has something to do with the fact that, at \\~4,100 lbs, it's still a a fat-ass car, and the weight was an ever-present part of the experience? Or it starts life as a comfortable family sedan? But then again, so does the M3. I can't for sure pin it down to one thing, but at the end of the day I never really \"felt\" and enjoyed the Tesla in the same way I felt and enjoyed my '99 Miata.\n\n# Tesla and the EV community\n\nThis is the part where I rage about Tesla and will probably ruffle some feathers. Too bad.\n\nLet me start off by saying that the service center (SC) employees are generally awesome - at least the one in my local SC. Tesla's engineers are brilliant, too. And it's refreshing to see a novel approach to building a car, where all the systems are so tightly integrated that everything feels \"whole\" vs. a bunch of different fiefdoms colliding into one car at the very end. And they're truly being innovative beyond just the fact that they're making EVs - Elon's woken up to the fact that manufacturing is no joke, and it sounds like they're doing their damnedest to make strides in this area as well. I wouldn't be surprised if ultimately their innovations in manufacturing outweigh their innovations everywhere else.\n\nBut I think all of their issues stem from dog-shit, stubborn management, rushing and not thinking things through carefully, an engineering-first approach, and Elon - a guy I can respect, but could use a serious ass-kicking once or twice.\n\nTheir quality control is abhorrent - we already know that. Model Ys being delivered with windshields not bonded into place is my favorite recent example. But the materials themselves are nothing to write home about, either. It's not bargain-basement bad, but the Model 3/Y certainly do *not* feel like $45K+ cars, except to clueless new owners who are just getting interested in cars for the first time. This really hit home for me the first time I cleaned my Model 3's interior - the carpets are literally like a glorified version of glovebox liner. The lauded \"vegan leather\" seats don't seem so great, either - look up the headrest bubbling issue on the Model 3. Which is an excellent segue into the mentality of \\*some\\* Tesla fanatics.\n\nBefore we dive into this, let's be clear - The **vast** majority of owners, as usual, are just normal people who don't care. Every car brand has its own subset of narrow-minded insufferable people who will die defending it, no matter what. What makes this subset of Tesla peeps especially unbearable is that they genuinely believe that they are saving the planet and have elevated Tesla to something more of a deity than a car company. So there's this undercurrent of holiness that accompanies the entire sphere and makes the proselytizing that much more infuriating. *\"Ew, ICE engines, what a stupid design!\"* Yeah. Our civilization got to where it is on AAA batteries!\n\nBut that's easy to ignore. The copious amounts of mental gymnastics going on in the community is what's truly saddening. I remember coming across one topic where a guy with a Model X was wondering how he was going to take his family on a ski trip past a supercharger desert in the Northeast. They bought a bunch of 12V heated blankets to avoid running the heat. This is a $100K+ SUV we're talking about.\n\nI came across countless other such examples where fashionable forfeiture serves as justification for buying into a nascent technology - \"Who needs to drive more than 200 miles, anyway?\" False analogies are rampant, also - \"ICE cars overheat too!\" - often in irrelevant comparisons largely due to being an established technology. There was one guy who was worried about using the heat in the wintertime and its impact on range. Someone replied and told him that he wasn't dressing appropriately for the weather.\n\nBack to the vegan leather headrest, otherwise known as \"plastic.\" (It's hilarious watching two camps of environmentalists collide - on one end, the bovine enthusiasts. On the other, the guys thinking they're saving the planet in a $100K+ EV carrying around 1,300 lbs+ in batteries.) Something similar started happening to mine, both on driver and passenger sides. Getting it replaced under warranty is hit and miss, because Tesla. According to this vocal minority in the Tesla community, it was, of course, my fault. Not that I'd damaged it intentionally, but that \"some hair products tend to do this\" (hint: I use none) or \"some people's body oils degrade car interiors\" (hint: No car I've ever owned has exhibited this problem, ever. Wife is a completely different race from me, same issue - the fact that I even feel the need mention this is ridiculous). One guy went as far as telling me that the problem was that I was using the headrest as a headrest. OK!\n\nEV blogs like electrek and insideEVs are especially abhorrent. Even as a new owner in my honeymoon phase, I stopped reading those a few months into my ownership. Articles are not written from the perspective of \"is Tesla great?\" but rather \"how great is Tesla, exactly?\"\n\nServicing a Tesla is also an exercise in patience. A number of crucial components like batteries and drive units are \"restricted.\" As a DIYer who keeps cars for a long time, this is extremely concerning in the way of Right to Repair. Rich Rebuilds goes on about this. But the company is in no rush to build and support an ecosystem of third-party repair, beyond bullshit like rotating tires. With any other regular car, there's an army of mechanics waiting to serve you should you run into problems.\n\nFinally, the whole \"software as a car\" thing is great - up to a point. It's sort of a double-edged sword. Towards the end of my ownership, my Model 3 started developing this strange intermittent bug that wouldn't let the car go to sleep. So it would inexplicably rip through 1.5% of its battery every hour, just sitting there in the parking lot. No way to tell this was happening. I'd just get into the car the next day and see that the range had gone down considerably overnight. Seeing that issue develop and become increasingly common was very concerning, especially knowing the entropy that can accompany the software lifecycle and Tesla's QC standards. It's one thing to have a bug in your nav, it's quite another when a bug can affect its fundamental operation as A CAR. And with OTA updates, don't assume that just because something works today, it will also work tomorrow. So even though the car is absolutely brilliant in the snow, I never took it skiing, for fear of returning to not only a cold-soaked battery, but also a surprise decrease in available range.\n\nAnd let's not even get into Full Self-Driving. Anyone who thinks that **truly** self-driving cars are anywhere on this side of 50 years will be sorely disappointed. I genuinely feel for the people plopping down $10K for this feature and hope it's mere pocket change in their world.\n\nAnd the yoke? lol\n\n# It's up to you.\n\nIf the downsides that I've laid out here are within your tolerance limits, and you're willing to bear the risk of being an early adopter, nobody can fault you for going with a BEV if it fits your lifestyle and needs. The Model 3, at the end of the day, is still a fantastic car for regular daily driving, for a lot of people.\n\nDo I think this is the end of EVs for me? No. Maybe for the time being, but I think that in 15 - 20 years, there will be far more well-rounded EVs on the market - battery or otherwise. The potential benefits purely from an ownership/convenience perspective are too great to ignore. And I do think that with their skateboard design, allowing them to \"circumvent\" the pedestrian safety regulations that have absolutely ruined the aesthetics of modern cars, EVs also have the potential to make cars beautiful again.\n\nI went into my Model 3 ownership experience with an open mind, and I genuinely learned a lot and have absolutely zero regrets about my experience. But in the end, I couldn't overlook its shortcomings, as I perceived them, for one simple reason: I just never fell in love with it. For you, things might be different.\n\nHappy New Year and let the internet rage begin!", "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "emojis": [], "location": {"profile_location": null, "geo_location": null, "nlp_location": null, "final_location": null, "tier": null, "country": "India", "state": null, "city": null}, "sentiment": {"label": "positive", "score": 0.43}, "keywords": ["why", "sold", "tesla", "model", "performance", "went"], "aspects": [{"aspect": "mileage", "sentiment": "positive", "score": 0.43}, {"aspect": "performance", "sentiment": "positive", "score": 0.43}, {"aspect": "comfort", "sentiment": "positive", "score": 0.43}, {"aspect": "safety", "sentiment": "positive", "score": 0.43}, {"aspect": "design", "sentiment": "positive", "score": 0.43}, {"aspect": "price", "sentiment": "positive", "score": 0.43}, {"aspect": "service", "sentiment": "positive", "score": 0.43}], "intent": "praise", "embedding": null, "embedding_model": null, "processed_at": "2025-10-03T17:36:37.581338Z", "source_id": "reddit:ca67c31cbd43", "target_vehicle": "Toyota Innova", "vehicle_category": "MPV/3-Row"}

I already own a Mercedes E-Class PHEV and I do like how easy it is to drive and find an available parking spot (the ev charging ones) , especially with a baby onboard.

Yes, I’m aware this incident took place in Thane and I’ve already shared it on the Thane subreddit. However, I’m posting here as well in the hope of reaching a wider audience — to bring more attention to what happened and to seek any possible help in identifying the vehicle or driver.\n\nThis happened at exactly 11:01 PM right outside the newly opened *Angel’s Juice Center*, located on the corner of the service road (location marked on the map below). I had stepped out to get water when I saw three dogs on the road — locals later told me they were a family: a father, a mother (who sadly died), and their pup.\n\nOne of the dogs was **peacefully sleeping, slightly in the middle of the service road**, but there was **ample space for the car to swerve** and pass from the side. And if not, the driver could've at least **stopped and honked**. It would’ve taken **20 seconds of patience**, but instead, this fucker **chose to run over the dog’s neck** without hesitation.\n\nI tried to stop the driver — he looked at me and just kept going. The woman in the passenger seat also clearly realized what had happened. They both knew they ran over the dog. It was a **dark blue Toyota Innova Hycross**, visible in the image I managed to capture (though it's blurry, as I was running and the car was in motion).\n\nThe dog was still alive — wagging her tail and bleeding from her mouth. A few of us rushed her to an animal hospital in Bhandup (marked open on Google), but she tragically died on the way. From how badly she was injured, I don’t think she had much of a chance — but we tried.\n\n# I really need help from this community.\n\nI know the image is blurry, but I managed to capture part of the number plate. It starts with **HR (Haryana)** and ends with **612**.\n\n* Can anyone **enhance the image** or help in **identifying the full number**?\n* Is there a way to **track vehicle details with this much info**?\n* Can anything be done to hold the driver accountable?\n\nEven though it may be hard to take legal action, I just **don’t want this to be ignored**. This was someone’s life, and it didn’t deserve to end like this.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kgxi1ktp1s5f1.png?width=1149&format=png&auto=webp&s=6595819646b10746a5cacd8b65191ecf9d25cac1\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c2n5nmtp1s5f1.png?width=439&format=png&auto=webp&s=bed3c9320a0f47840dc750185da9607e01aa2416\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u8mlcotp1s5f1.jpg?width=2268&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b35aef791217925e3f0c4cfb3ab92736e83f71ab", "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "emojis": [], "location": {"profile_location": null, "geo_location": null, "nlp_location": null, "final_location": null, "tier": null, "country": "India", "state": null, "city": null}, "sentiment": {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.0}, "keywords": ["car", "ran", "over", "dog", "teen", "hath"], "aspects": [{"aspect": "performance", "sentiment": "neutral", "score": 0.0}, {"aspect": "comfort", "sentiment": "neutral", "score": 0.0}, {"aspect": "design", "sentiment": "neutral", "score": 0.0}, {"aspect": "service", "sentiment": "neutral", "score": 0.0}], "intent": "query", "embedding": null, "embedding_model": null, "processed_at": "2025-10-03T17:36:37.590365Z", "source_id": "reddit:5d255b089695", "target_vehicle": "Toyota Innova", "vehicle_category": "MPV/3-Row"}

I've posted in r/pune too, but I need and will appreciate responses here too.. Just this afternoon in Pune, I was driving my scooter on a road, which is not crowded at all anytime otherwise, but today was full of traffic due to a local election. I had gone just one turn away from my house, and then I bumped into an Innova in front of me.. the Innova had also braked.I don't fully recall though if it was the driver's fault or mine, there was a little dent and scratch on the back plastic guard, and it was unusual bumper to bumper traffic ahead of us.\n\nDriver said he will call owner till then told me to wait. I told him I have to go somewhere, and that it's a minor thing, still I waited. When the owner came he said its too much of work, it is new vehicle etc (I looked it up online, the plastic part would be around 3-4k).\n\nThey checked my vehicle too, and found it dented, but I told him it was caused much earlier. All there was due to today's impact was a little white paint from the Innova plastic part. I had to give them my name, mobile, vehicle number, but I have the driver's number only, not the owner's.\n\nI asked the guy his name, and looked him up on fb, also checked his vehicle number on RTO site. Found that the guy is a wrestler and son of a local rural NCP politician..the types who flaunt their wealth.. and that the vehicle is registered in the father's name. \n\nIn the end I told him that I braked still it hit, I apologised many times and even told him I didn't do it purposely, had it been my fault I would have ran off right away, he said we will see..not that he threatened me in any way but I'm really tensed after discovering this info about him.

But with the explosion of real estate as a speculative investment vehicle, we have lost almost all of them. Here is the reality check. I have been road tripping (and still do) around these areas for over 15 years now. I have seen the drastic fall in our scenic locations. And the reason I write this is to raise awareness that if we don't take stock of the situation, what's left will soon go as well.*\n\nAlso worth noting is that in all of these routes (on the road), it's next to impossible to find good clean Maharashtrian food. A delicious simple thali, like the one from Girija in Pune will also do. But even the food on most of these routes is shit. (except of course once you read Alibaugh/Lonavala/Mahabaleswar towns, you will find one or two nice places).\n\n**Mumbai - Lonavala** used to be a good drive. Now, till the beginning of the expressway it's kind of sad. On the expressway till the first toll booth, the road is enveloped in construction. Skyscrapers are coming up. The hills are being cut down (you can see that in Vashi itself). From the first toll booth to Lonavala is a ride up the ghats which is a slow moving heavy truck zone with thousands of vehicles struggling with their old under-powered engines in first gear creating plenty of pollution. SO this drive is over. Out.\n\nOn the old highway the story is the same. Plus add to it pedestrians, random indiscliplined two wheelers, anything goes. And speed breakers. Do not forget the speed breakers.\n\nPlus Lonavala is pretty much like Goregaon East now. Over construction, much of the green cover has been lost, traffic jams, and damn every shop selling that same shitty fake Chikki. You are better off spending your weekend in Colaba. It will be less crowded than Lonavala. Now there is even a mall and a McDonald's at Lonavala. \n\n**Mumbai- Goa** Used to be a good drive about 20 years ago. I have been here on a bike for the first time in 2002.. It was nice. I mean the route is beautiful in parts, but it is still single lane in most parts, with random diversions for two laning (or four). which has been going on forever. Being single laned, you will have an annoying slow moving vehicle in front and a restless Innova behind and no way to get ahead. I have had state buses hurl at me, in my side of the road, at full speed, only to cut left at the last minute. This highway is traumatic. And it also has one of the highest accident rates in India, I believe.\n\n**Mumbai - Mahabaleshwar** This route goes via NH4 (Mumbai Pune) crosses Pune and another probably 100km ahead. Till Lonavala the highway is non-scenic. From Lonavala till the second Toll booth, the highway has hills and forests on either side which is nice. But they are fast being degraded. If you care, please call the Pune forest division and urge them to keep grazers and forest burners out.\n\nFrom Pune till the right crossing for Mahabaleswar is shit. Full of construction, concrete, diversions, bad roads and millions of two wheelers and other traffic. There is a small ghat in between much after Katraj, which is ok, but that's only a few KM. Once you exit the NH4 and take the right to Mahabaleshwar, the road is nice only in stretches. \n\nMabaleshwar itself is over developed. Over concretised, loud and crowded. No longer the quaint secluded getaway. If I ran a resort in Mahabaleshwar, I would try and do something to immediately stop any more construction, grow more trees, and work towards reducing traffic.\n\n**Mumbai - Igatpuri** Its mostly hell. Till Kalyan-Bhiwandi you wish you had an autonomous vehicle so you could sleep it off. At Kasara, a few KM of the ghats are nice. Rest everything has been cut down for 'town ships', factories, second/third/fourth homes, and what not. This route is also not recommened.\nIgatpuri itself is a tiny dusty little over-crowded town now. If you looked hard enough you would find maybe a few old charming homes, but just for them travelling and enduring all this is not worth it.\n\n**Mumbai to Alibaugh** Most of the road is the Mumbai Goa road (read above). It is shit. You will want to run away at the enormous traffic jams and ugliness at Vadkal Naka. Once you take the right towards Alibaugh, the road becomes nice in parts though. But see concretisation everywhere.\n\n**Mumbai To Kashid** Same as Mumbai to Alibaug. Around in 2004 when I first went to Kashid and Murud Janjira, the place was awesome. It had gentky rollimng meadows on one side and the sea on the other. Now most of the beach facing land has been bought, second/third/forth houses buyilt, rest is fenced off, natural vegetaion burnt/cut to make plots for sale easier.\n\n**Mumbai to Malshej Ghat** : See Mumbai to Igatpuri. Till Kalyan the ride is shit. Once you take a right from Kalyan the route is pretty fucked up till maybe 50km or more. Kalyan town is full of speed breakers every maybe 50 metres. Too much traffic, and litter. Once you start exiting the town, there is litter on both sides and gazillions of 'real estate' projects coming up. Only much ahead, after you cross one of the first ghats does the scenery become slightly better. But large ugly stop overs are ruining what was there. Why dont people make more blended in stop overs?\n\nThis part of Maharashtra used to be gorgeous. But we have lost it.

Is it possible? Could we create a political party to win *just* Bangalore? Assuming every techie from outside the city/state and within chose to vote for only this new political party, it might stand a chance. But then, what could a handful of MPs and MLAs hope to achieve if the rest of the voting population of the state chooses to vote for those who were traditionally voted into power on the basis of their long years of experience and ground support. We'll still need new corporators/councilors/ward members from this new party to control the BBMP, but God knows when those elections will be held, *IF* they will be held at all. When they smell a competitor on the rise, one who wants to usurp their thrones for the good of the city, they'll throw their considerable financial resources into destabilizing it, nip it in the bud, stamp it out. They'll count on our inexperience and naiveté taking over when we hit our first obstacles, making the movement stillborn. \n\nThen we wonder if we can count on our celebrated social media cult figures who have been hyped up to Keanu levels until a small, skeptical nagging voice in the back of our heads reasons that they might have their own selfish agenda. We can only hope this agenda might also, as a byproduct, serve the greater good (chorus chant *the greater good* with me).

Hey Everyone,\nLet me dive straight into this tale of chaos that unfolded during what was supposed to be a carefree weekend bike ride from Bengaluru to Tamil Nadu. Picture this: three bikes cruising down the highway, laughter and camaraderie filling the air, until we decided to take a break. I stopped my bike, letting my friends continue on their journey, blissfully unaware of the storm brewing ahead.\n\nSuddenly, a horrifying clash shattered our tranquility. One of our bikers, caught off guard by the erratic braking of an Innova, collided with it. It became painfully clear that the driver was drunk, and to our dismay, he and his companions were from Tamil Nadu. Instantly, chaos erupted as a menacing group of ten emerged from the car, their intent clear. They descended upon my friends like wolves, beating them mercilessly and snatching three of them away, threatening further violence if we dared to follow.\n\nIn desperation, we raced to the nearest police station, but our hopes were dashed as the officers, more interested in lining their pockets, demanded bribes instead of offering help. Just when we thought all was lost, one of the kidnapped friends managed to call me. His voice trembled as he revealed their captors hailed from Salem and were demanding a ransom of 50,000 rupees for their release. With no other option, we reluctantly complied, sending the money via UPI, praying for their safe return.\n\nThey were released in the desolate middle of nowhere, but not without a cost; one friend returned with a broken nose, a brutal reminder of the ordeal. Fortuitously, one of the kidnapped was the son of a politician, and he vowed to escalate this matter to higher authorities to ensure justice is served. ⚖️\n\nLet this serve as a cautionary tale: may no one else endure such a harrowing experience. I hold a deep respect for Tamil culture and its people, but the demons we encountered were a stark contrast to the warmth I know.\n\n\nDisclaimer: I did use chatGPT to rephrase sentences because I felt it would be more clear to whoever so is reading this :)", "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "emojis": [], "location": {"profile_location": null, "geo_location": null, "nlp_location": null, "final_location": null, "tier": null, "country": "India", "state": null, "city": null}, "sentiment": {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.0}, "keywords": ["personal", "bengaluru", "kidnap", "incident", "hey", "everyone"], "aspects": [{"aspect": "performance", "sentiment": "neutral", "score": 0.0}, {"aspect": "comfort", "sentiment": "neutral", "score": 0.0}, {"aspect": "price", "sentiment": "neutral", "score": 0.0}], "intent": "query", "embedding": null, "embedding_model": null, "processed_at": "2025-10-03T17:36:37.598639Z", "source_id": "reddit:7f1b560ad64c", "target_vehicle": "Toyota Innova", "vehicle_category": "MPV/3-Row"}

I got a bit scared as if I had been a bit to the right, they would have easily dashed into me. I was in the left lane while they were in the right lane going in the same direction as me (totally wrong side). I honked at them and they did not even look back, then I saw them being busy chatting on their phone. I gave up and continued my journey.\n\n  \n2. While coming back home, on the Sinhgad Clg road, I was riding safely and all of a sudden a swift came at me from the left, luckily I had enough time (and space as no vehicle in the opposite lane and no-one behind me) to react and swerved to the right to avoid a collision. Once again, I checked what the driver is doing and saw they are busy chatting with their friends / relatives in the car. \n\n\n\n3, If you complain about them being wrong, get ready to get beaten up or something. At this point, I feel hopeless in the law & order as well as civic sense of this city.\n\n\n\n4. Auto drivers try their best to rip you off. If you use Uber, many times they will rant about how Uber takes some commission, but if you try going direct, they do not want to go unless you pay 2.5 times of the usual fare. \n\n  \n5. The roads are real bad with no real markings on speed-breakers. Kuthe sulta speedbreaker tar kadhi ulta !\n\n\n\nI have been to many cities, and yes, I am not going to say that this is something which only happens in Pune, but lately such incidents have been happening a lot. Many of my friends and relatives also complain to me about similar experiences.

Please advise.. Just this afternoon, I was driving my scooter on a road, which is not crowded at all anytime otherwise, but today was full of traffic due to a local election. I had gone just one turn away from my house, and then I bumped into an Innova in front of me.. the Innova had also braked.I don't fully recall though if it was the driver's fault or mine, there was a little dent and scratch on the back plastic guard, and it was unusual bumper to bumper traffic ahead of us.\n\nDriver said he will call owner till then told me to wait. I told him I have to go somewhere, and that it's a minor thing, still I waited. When the owner came he said its too much of work, it is new vehicle etc (I looked it up online, the plastic part would be around 3-4k).\n\nThey checked my vehicle too, and found it dented, but I told him it was caused much earlier. All there was due to today's impact was a little white paint from the Innova plastic part.\n\nI had to give them my name, mobile, vehicle number, where I live approximately, but I have the driver's number only, not the owner's.\n\nI asked the guy his name, and looked him up on fb, also checked his vehicle number on RTO site. Found that the guy is a wrestler and son of a local rural NCP politician..the types who flaunt their wealth.. and that the vehicle is registered in the father's name. \n\nIn the end I told him that I braked still it hit, I apologised many times and even told him I didn't do it purposely, had it been my fault I would have ran off right away, he said we will see..not that he threatened me in any way but I'm really tensed after discovering this info about him.

So after my last translation the highest voted article and some reactions of the farmer protest, I have been planning to translate a  more detailed analysis on the situation of farmers and India agriculture. I originally planed to use another article on Zhihu, but this newest one posted by Guancha News 3 days ago appear to be more in deep so I chose this one.\n\nSome background:\n\n1. Guancha News is a newly rising non-state media with heavy right-wing nationalism background. It generally use communism slogans but only as catchword, and ultimately support the current Chinese gov.\n2. Chinese people generally don’t know much about India, and would be quite interested in the Communism party of India even if it is basically dead. So a lot of Chinese articles would mention it when discussing India. Don’t be confused seeing coverage on it again lol.\n3. This article contains many errors even from my own knowledge, like suggesting the progress of India gov is because the pressure of Communism party of India, but as its main topic is to explain the India farmer struggles, I still think it worth translating. So I chose it anyway.\n\n**Corrections or refutations on this article are welcome and precious, and I will post them back to Chinese internet.**\n\nIf you have any questions about China you can leave comments below, I'm planning to make a summary post to answer your questions(will not answer them right now).\n\nThis translation contains about 3600 words.\n\n**Title: Farmers keep protesting, but Modi must win this time**\n\nTime:2021/02/24\n\nView count:929K\n\nLike:79K\n\nBeginning in 2020, farmers from all over India flocked to the capital New Delhi to protest the Modi government's agricultural reform bills, and since then the disturbance has become more and more serious. The farmers have been very tough. They drove tractors and trucks directly into the streets and blocked the roads, and Sikh cavalry even broke through police roadblocks on horses. These conflicts clearly shows that, \"Nobody can feel well until this matter is solved\" . The Indian police were tough too. Batons, water cannons, and tear gas, all showed up, with local government pulling out the network to prevent farmers from gathering. Good things do not go out, bad things spread for thousands of miles(A Chinese idiom). After the Trump topic, the western medias have turned their cameras to their dear 3rd world folks again. Canadian Prime Minister Trudeau, American actress Rihanna, and environmental activist Greta all expressed their support for farmers, and in the Super Bowl, there were advertisements supporting Indian farmers being played. Maybe they should go start \"Farmer lives matter\" campaign, maybe this would has some real influence. (The author is being sarcastic here)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Sikh cavalry on street](https://preview.redd.it/kwmt6aaezbk61.png?width=553&format=png&auto=webp&s=641cb9ef0fe1df5fa8f6f53d0feeb8191282b754)\n\n**We can say the agricultural reforms has caused the Modi government to be troubled both internally and externally, but why has Modi insisted so far and still refuses to let go?**\n\n**Let's start with the conclusion first:** The Indian version of “unified purchase and sale”(统购统销, A policy of China between 1950\\~1980s, don’t know its English name so I translated it in my own way) has caused the government to not be able to purchase enough from rural areas, and failed to help industrialization, and on the other hand it still has to spend huge amounts of money to subsidize small farmers. The core issue is the autonomy of rural India, which consumes most of the labor surplus, and the major significance is to loot the gov funds. Therefore, if Modi wants to modernize India, he must make a big move in the countryside.\n\n**Part one, history and the forming of Mandis**\n\nLet’s start with some history. The core of the British control of India is the Zamindar system, which is a \"tax contract\" system, designed to exploit India to the maximum. In the 18th century, when Britain invaded India, it found that it had too few people to rule effectively. It wanted to collect money but was unable to govern and collect. After the collapse of the Mughal Empire, countless feudal states were formed everywhere, and the East India Company signed treaties with them and established a  vassal alliance. After the Indian states joined, as long as they pay the “protection fee”, which is the tax British want, they can enjoy protection of the East India Company. In order to ensure their own rule, the Indian states flocked to British side. By the mid-19th century, the East India Company directly ruled half of India, while the other half of India was all members of the alliance.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[A painting of British and Indian state signing contracts](https://preview.redd.it/2yx4p6ghzbk61.png?width=554&format=png&auto=webp&s=abfe90f29560ce3d148d7b04d25521efd47d9fde)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThese of Indian states then became the tax collectors of the East India Company. As long as the money collected is enough to pay the British people, the rest is their own. In this way, the British can sit down and make a fortune without governance costs, and the East India Corporate Bond became the most popular investment in London stock market. The Indian states did not understand investment-growth model and only increase taxes madly for own benefits. Farmers were hovering on the line of hunger of death. This model finally lead to the Indian National Uprising in 1857. Although the uprising ultimately failed, it has planted the seeds of nationalism and pushed the Indian people toward independence.\n\nIn 1947, India finally gained independence and could choose its own development path now. At that time, there were three possible models. The first was to join the trade markets with Britain and US economy; the second was to learn from the Soviet Union and to pursue industrialization with planned economy model; the third was to follow Gandhi and reverse history, restore the natural economy of small peasants groups in history. The leader of India, Nehru, favored Soviet model, but India has its own conditions too. He must make decisions while still considering both the Indian elites studying in the UK, and Gandhi’s followers. The result in the agricultural sector was the Mandis system, which is the Indian version of “unified purchase and sales”.\n\n**Part two, analysis on Mandis and Indian agriculture development**\n\nWhy do we say it is the “Indian version”, not a real one? Because considering local interests, the India government designates big landlords and big merchants to be agricultural intermediaries. Farmers' agricultural products can only be sold to them with the official price designated, which is usually quite low. In addition, farmers have to pay 1% as the management fee and 4% as the commission fee. The agricultural products collected will be sold at 1,000 wholesale markets to maintain urban supply. In short, the Mandis system is to give local tycoons the power of monopoly merchants in exchange for taxes and stability. But any policy has costs. The official requisition price is too low, and farmers can hardly survive on farming. What should be done? The Indian government has issued policies to subsidize small farmers. India's finances do not account for a high proportion of GDP usually, but every year it spends 2% of GDP to subsidize rural areas, with fertilizer alone accounts for one-third.\n\nIn fact, the Mantis system sounds quite reasonable at first glance. In the early stages of industrial countries, it's normal to implement “unified purchase and sales” more or less in rural areas to support urban development. But India still has the problem that, it doesn’t learn the full image when it comes to learning. The Chinese, Soviet version of “unified purchase and sales” first eliminated the purely exploiting class of landlords, followed by the establishment of industrial and agricultural price scissors, and the rapid establishment of an industrial system. However India, in order to take care of various interest groups, has allowed the landlords and businessmen to act aggressively, and the state still spends a lot of money to subsidize small farmers.\n\nProduction relations and productivity interact and form each other. With such a tangled agricultural system, India, with the world's most arable land, has long been dependent on food imports. by 1960, India had to import 16 million tons of grain. In 1965, India was suffering from a severe drought, and the weird Mandis system seems come to its collapse. But this year, the Green Revolution happened, and India took the initiative to introduce western crops, which is much simpler than reforming the Mandis system. In just ten years, more than a quarter of India's crops have been replaced with high-yielding species. Coupled with advances in farming technology and chemical fertilizers, the wheat yield per Hector in India rose six times in 1975 comparing to 1945. At this point, the Malthus trap seems to have said goodbye to India.\n\nHowever, although technological progress is important, the management level should also keep up, or it can only delay the explosion of the bomb and cannot completely solve the existing contradictions. The major problem of Indian agriculture sector still exists. One is the insufficient level of agricultural intensification, as more than 80% of farmers are individually small ones, unable to collect enough capita to mechanize and irrigate. The other is that fertilizers has been using extensively, and pollutes groundwater and rivers. In other words, small farmer model has reached the upper limit of the effect of fertilizer. The third is the old problem. The government is too weak to organize water conservancy irrigation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Small farmers in India](https://preview.redd.it/mqfc38djzbk61.png?width=553&format=png&auto=webp&s=5ea7d9c406f82b2ad4b6bcce5d8575630ca4aeee)\n\nThe yield of Indian agriculture has entered a bottleneck and stagnated. In 2013, India’s rice yield was 2,400 kg per hector. By 2019, it was still only about 2,550Kg per hector, contrasting China with 7,500 kg. The population of India is still growing, with 20 million more mouths to feed every year. India's agricultural reform is imminent, as this Mandis model will soon be unsustainable.\n\nIn addition, increasing grain production consumes water. We have all studied geography in high school, that India’s climate has “rain heat synchronization”, which is very conducive to agriculture. However, India has unstable rainfall and lack of water conservancy facilities, resulting drought and flood. In order to grow grain, they have to dig wells to consume underground water massively. This leads to excessive exploitation, which eventually leads to land desertification and soil degradation. India’s statistics show that in 2019, one-third of the land shows degrading, covering an area of more than 100 million hectares, which is already close to China’s total arable land area.\n\nBesides the production problem, acquisition, sales, storage, and transportation are the major issues too. In the past, when India designed the system, it was worried about businessmen hoarding. Therefore, legislation restricted the amount of goods in stock, and they had to sell them if storage exceeded the amount. This laws has prevented merchants from investing in cold storage and improving storage conditions. Crops are seasonal and must be harvested at a certain point. Small farmers cannot afford the expensive cold storage, so they have to sell them immediately. Every year, in a short period of time, a large number of agricultural products would flood into the market and cannot be consumed soon. The backward storage and transportation system caused many agricultural products waiting to rot. According to a report from the Central Bank of India, 40% of India's fruits and vegetables are rotten before sold. In the non-harvest seasons, the backward infrastructure can't maintain enough inventory, and the demand quickly exceeds supply, resulting the soaring prices and angry consumers. The best example is the problem of onion, the most important vegetable in India, but its price still can fluctuate greatly every year, causing social problems. The reason is that under the Mandis system, a large number of onions are wasted during storage and transportation. According to the Economist, every three onions in India experience loading, sorting, and repackaging for four times, there’s one being wasted.\n\nThe “unified purchase and sale” of agricultural products was originally a policy implemented in the early stages of industrialized countries. On the basis of not affecting the lives of small farmer too much, the stability of the market and urban supply were ensured. Once cities and industries develop, the government will then feed back the rural areas through technical means, employment opportunities, and capital transfers. But the Mandis system uses administrative means to forcibly maintain the small-scale peasant economy, while industrialization is still insufficient. It uses a large amount of funds to subsidize small-scale peasants, and the longer developing, the higher the subsidy becomes.\n\n**Part 3, The rural autonomous system**\n\nIf India's capital accumulation process is likened to a bucket, the Mandis system is a relatively large crack above it, and there are still opportunities to make up for it. The shortcoming that really hinders capital accumulation is actually India's rural autonomous system. This structure is parasitic on small farmers, and they use their power to absorb government subsidies, but cannot promote economic and social progress. In the end, it has become a major, major problem for India.\n\nAfter independence, India implemented a federal system, divided into three levels. The federal government is at highest, with state government under it. Below them, each state has a local autonomous system under its jurisdiction. All levels are in charge of affairs at their own levels, and the federal government does not intervene in local governance. The advantage is that this new country has maintained its unity, and there has been no major unrest for more than 60 years, but the disadvantage is huge at the rural levels.\n\nThe rural self-government system with Indian characteristics is called \"Panchayat\". It can be traced back to ancient India. The rulers of ancient India only collected taxes, the grassroots  governing relied on autonomy, and village governance was controlled by the high caste elders. They form a five-person meeting, responsible for tax collection, documents, arbitration, etc., and the size of the affairs is collectively decided. Using the concept of modern politics, this is called the trinity of administration, legislation, and justice. Therefore, \"Panchayat\" autonomy is only a concept in contrast to the central government, while its name in countryside is actually a caste aristocratic republic, and it is easy to see which class has benefited. After the founding of India, this set of things became the foundation of the country. Gandhi once said, \"India is not a few big cities, but 700,000 villages.\"\n\nThe \"Panchayat\" system was re-promoted after some modernize modifications. The villagers can directly elect managers, and each village had one chairman and five committees, and managed themselves. By 1992, India passed a constitutional amendment to reduce the management burden of the state government, and delegated more power to \"Panchayat\". We all have studied politics in high school that, the basic principle of citizen participation in politics is the unity of rights and obligations. Water distribution in the dry seasons, women's rights, poverty alleviation, and education were originally the responsibilities of the state government, and they were all delegate. The problem is that \"Panchayate\" can only solve very limited problems. They can manage the villages help each other and can ensure that you won’t starve in a disaster year, that’s it.How to help the poor in poor villages? How to ensure the equal distribution of water resources? This well-written law has implied: by democracy in the village(The author is being sarcastic again). But even democracy is effective, the question is, \"Pancharyat\" is only a formal democracy. In fact, the participation in the village meeting is very low. It is still the elders who have the final say.\n\nAs a result, The village's finances are extremely dependent on the state government, and 90% of the expenditure depends on subsidies to get the money. The most important thing for the elders often is to loot the gov funds to further strengthen their political status. In addition, the traditional problems in rural India include the caste system and old backward customs. The \"Panchayat\" system often cannot stand on the progressive side, but on the conservative and backward side, directly hindering social progress. Like In the Indian movie \"Toilet: A Love Story\", MC wanted to build a toilet at home and the village elders felt that the old rules were offended and stood up to stop him. The elders are also against free love, even make “honorary murder” sentences. In June 2012, a couple appeared on the Amir Khan's(The most known Indian in China after Ghandi, Modi, very popular) TV show and criticized the village for interfering in marriage. As a result, in November of that year, the woman's brother kidnapped and killed her husband. It was not until this time that the issue of “honour murder” attracted some real attention of the country. To sum up, “Panchayat” system is 360-degree pure reactionary with nothing worth complimenting.\n\nI know there are little clever audiences would say, can't we reform or destroy \"Panchayat\"? Some people really think so. The first is the Naxalite, which advocates armed riots from the countrysides, destroy the old \"Panchayat\" and re-establish a new grassroot level system. They were active in the eastern, central and southern parts of India. However, after Modi and the BJP came to power in the past few years, India's grassroots governance capabilities have greatly strengthened, so the Naxalite has gradually declined. There were more than 8,000 people in 2013, and they can only work underground. Although their attempts are likely to face failure, as Che Guevara said, “after we leave, the government will give you schools and hospitals and raise wages. This is not because of their conscience, nor because they have become good people, but because we have been here”.\n\n[Che Guevara](https://preview.redd.it/qbrbxw9lzbk61.png?width=378&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c46ec8812660f816b16442b08523c8e1db5d1c6)\n\nThe first is not working, and the second is the current undercover route. First, the Mandis system would be eliminated through agricultural reforms to destroy the economic foundation of \"Panchayat\". Modi's current reforms firstly abolished the middleman system and allowed farmers to sell agricultural products freely; secondly, they abolished enterprise reserve restrictions; and thirdly, they let the market freely determine the prices of agricultural products. The central idea is to realize the marketization of Indian agriculture, strengthen agricultural enterprises and markets, and eliminate the small farmers class, eventually. When small farmers enter the city, \"Panchayat\" will gradually disintegrate, and the government will replace it with RSS. We often say that RSS is a copycat Nazi stormtrooper, but this organization can at least count the Covid cases in rural areas, build small thermal power stations and toilets. Their mobilization power and coverage is already the strongest in Indian history.\n\nReforms will definitely touch interests. This time Modi's reforms extend his reach to rural areas and agriculture, and the next step is likely to directly mobilize farmers. Those who suffer the most would be these landlord elders and the original middlemen, as they are traditional rural messengers. So they must mobilize farmers to take protests. Out of cultural inertia, coupled with the fear of damage to their interests, the first reaction of small farmers was to oppose reforms. Then there was the news that “farmers besieged New Delhi”. In fact, this phenomenon was stated in the Communist Manifesto that, **The aristocracy, in order to rally the people to them, waved the proletarian alms-bag in front for a banner. But the people, so often as it joined them, saw on their hindquarters the old feudal coats of arms, and deserted with loud and irreverent laughter.**\n\nOkay and it's time to make a conclusion. I know that some friends will be dissatisfied when they see this place. They feel that what Modi did is to let capitalists replace the feudal master to exploit, and feel that the struggle of peasants will be more serious. I can only say that, **on the path of modernization, catching up of the late-developing countries is bound to be cruel, and there must be a certain class’s interests damaged**. The small peasant stratum's production methods are backward, and social consciousness cannot meet the needs of modernization. This is also a cold reality. Throughout the world, the most important thing in the modernization of late-developing countries is to solve the problem of where resources or investments come from. India originally wanted to rely on the service industry to drive subsidies for agricultural modernization, but the result was that the service industry was not very inclusive, and the money spent in the countryside was looted into local Panchayat. It was impossible to do anything at all. Looking at it now, the only stable and feasible model is probably only the East Asian model, which is to build an industrial-agricultural price scissor internally, squeeze resources from farmers, step by step to eliminate the small peasant class, break the shackles of small communities, and build a large community, which will put more than a billion in various forms to become real Indians, allowing young people to receive modern education first, and then have the opportunity to enter the factory, take over the industrial chain of the developed country, and then upgrade the industrial chain. After east Asia, this model has been done in many SEA countries too, and in Bangladesh next door. The best ideal result for India would be to attract middle and low-end manufacturing from China and Southeast Asia, undertake industrial transfer, and attract foreign investment to build itself into a new South Asian factory. After the disintegration of the self-government of rural areas, the control of the Indian government can then reach the grassroots level, and then the construction of basic medical and endowment insurance can be started. Having said so much, we can't change Modi's situation anyway. We can only pray that Modi has boundless magic power and can smoothly implement the bill, leading India to economic and political modernization, and contributing to the community of shared future for mankind.", "hashtags": ["#x200B"], "mentions": [], "emojis": [], "location": {"profile_location": null, "geo_location": null, "nlp_location": "Delhi, India", "final_location": "Delhi, India", "tier": "Tier-1", "country": "India", "state": "Delhi", "city": "Delhi"}, "sentiment": {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.0}, "keywords": ["translation", "farmers", "keep", "protesting", "but", "modi"], "aspects": [{"aspect": "mileage", "sentiment": "neutral", "score": 0.0}, {"aspect": "performance", "sentiment": "neutral", "score": 0.0}, {"aspect": "safety", "sentiment": "neutral", "score": 0.0}, {"aspect": "design", "sentiment": "neutral", "score": 0.0}, {"aspect": "price", "sentiment": "neutral", "score": 0.0}, {"aspect": "service", "sentiment": "neutral", "score": 0.0}], "intent": "query", "embedding": null, "embedding_model": null, "processed_at": "2025-10-03T17:36:37.644093Z", "source_id": "reddit:48570b9537eb", "target_vehicle": "MG Hector", "vehicle_category": "Mid-size SUV"}

Post a period of decline and confusion post Ghurid decline and domination by Iranian Khwarezmids, Khaljis ruled over modern day Pakistan and large tracts of North, West and Southern India.\n\n1325-1525 AD: this was a period where Afghanistan was chewed up a lot by the Mongols and mostly kept within hemmed within the Timurid empire.\n\n1525-1738: Mughals. Afghanistan was splintered into 3 parts the western part being ruled by Iranian Safavids, Northern by the Mongol Khanates and Eastern by the Mughals. Afghans did very well under the Mughals - Babur more or less considered Kabul as his home and Afghan soldiers and administrators were key in ruling the entirety of the subcontinent, throughout its length.\n\n1747-1823: Durranis. Post a hiatus caused by Iranian Nader Shah, Afghans consolidated and unified under Ahmed Shah Abdali and established rule over modern day Pakistan and parts of North India.\n\n1830-1947: Emirate of Afghanistan. With the coming in of the British rule in India, the Afghan rule abated but it was marked by three Anglo-Afghan wars and countless skirmishes where Afghanistan repeatedly disrupting territory in modern day Pakistan. Constant skirmishes and raids made the frontier known as a wild, restive region.\n\n1947-73: Kingdom of Afghanistan. The Durand line caused several skirmishes with Pakistan including serious ones in '49, '55 and '60.\n\n1973-96: Republic of Afghanistan. The soviet satellite which was devastated by the Afghan war saw conflict often spill to Pakistan, thousands of Pakistanis directly died fighting in the war.\n\n1996-2001: Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan. Taliban ruled over the part of Afghanistan excluding controlled by Northern Alliance for all of five years. However in this period, Taliban either directly exported or gave refuge to mujahedin mercenaries who went on to fight in far flung areas from Chechnya, North Africa, South East Asia, Kashmir, Xinjiang and ultimately the conspiracy which hit New York. Meanwhile they caused major problems to India with militancy in Kashmir reaching historic highs.\n\n2001-present: Transition government. Involved in numerous skirmishes with Pakistan. However the real challenge came via Tehreek e Taliban Pakistan, which ran an insurgency which resulted in the deaths of thousands of Pakistani soldiers and tens of thousands of civilians.\n\n**Insight:** We therefore have the history lesson of a thousand years to conclude that **Afghans, inevitably prey on other nations - this trend is only reinforced when Afghans are consolidated and united** under a single authority - as seems to be happening right now.\n\n**With this insight here is my attempt at reading geo-pol tea leaves,**\n\n1. **US, EU:** Tactically the retreat is a big win as the coalition rids itself from the world's first trillion dollar war which was needlessly propping up a thoroughly incompetent and corrupt Afghan plant regime. The biggest beneficiaries of the massive Allied effort clobbered into place by Bush's hectoring, ironically, were countries who were fence sitters: India which saw Kashmir insurgency ebb, Uighurs in China, Chechens in Russia, assorted militant groups in the Middle East, East and West Africa - all saw their \"safe space\" being taken away giving the respective nations a chance at respite and shoring defenses. Yes, there were the ISILs of the worldbut with an Afghanistan under Taliban, the situation would only have been much worse. The sheriff of the world can therefore hang his boots and take some well deserved rest. However, fully expect AQ and other old ghosts of the past to re-emerge within the next couple of years causing violent terror attacks on the west to surge. Politically this may strengthen right-wing parties.\n2. **China:** A major stink bomb just went off in China's backyard. I fully expect most BRI projects to stall and die out as the region is engulfed in a massive spiral of violence. While I do think any potential Uighur upsurge will be crushed down with a mailed fist, it will still cause China problems on its Eastern front where it wants to otherwise single mindedly focus on India. There already are reports of Uyghurs making up a few thousands in number of the Taliban. Overall the stakes in South China Sea and the Malacca straits as the only reliable trade route will increase and China's efforts to militarily secure this route will also build pressure on ASEAN, Taiwan and Japan - increasing instability and likelihood of war.\n3. **Russia and the Stans:** A Taliban victory is terrible news for Putin and other assorted dictators who rule the Stans. I fully expect separatist movements from Tatarstan to Chechnya to reignite. Ditto for Stans as Uzbeks, Tajiks etc now make up 40% of the Taliban and they will be more than eager to spread their banner over the countries of their ethnicity. Realpolitik from the West will only encourage these efforts to shake up Putin's throne.\n4. **India:** Like the ANA, India was also afforded 20 years to prep up its defenses. While one has clearly failed, it is to be seen how well India is able to deal with the surely coming upsurge in militancy. I fully expect a massive spike in fighter numbers, weapons and tech in the Kashmir insurgency. The more disturbing scenario is - in an increasingly communally divided India, such violence can also boil over to other parts of the country which have otherwise been quiet for two decades. The Taliban are essentially Deobandi and Barelvi - both Islamic movements with 10s of millions of followers in India as well, worst case scenario could see a massive influx of radicalized Indians who receive training and weapons in Afghanistan and wreck havoc in India, derailing the already stalled economic progress. Overall a grim outlook faces India.\n5. **Middle East, Africa and Turkey:** This region may face a divergent outlook. For most nations - Islamic movements will now have a safe sanctuary to organize, train, plot and gain strength - to challenge the dictatorships that rule these countries. Given the often extremely reactionary and short term thinking that the leaderships of these countries indulge in, some might even fund and facilitate such activities. However, Qatar and Turkey - might actually gain geo-pol by using Afghanistan's strength in waging asymmetric war by acting as agents that trade in this commodity. Fully expect civil wars and violence to reach new heights. Also tensions between Turkey-Qatar and GCC bloc may rise.\n6. **Iran:** Given that Afghanistan is 90-95% Sunni, the scenario looks bad for Iran as Sunni militants there will gain much strength. Like China however it is in a position to brutally clamp down on such movements. I do not however, see any silver lining for Iran as Taliban gain complete domination in Kabul. Iran may become more tightly coupled with the Turkish-Qatari axis to save its skin from the Taliban, in turn fueling tensions vs Saudi led GCC.\n7. **Pakistan**: Taliban gaining absolute control over Afghanistan in my opinion has the worst portends for Pakistan. What the western media characterizes as Pakistan's \"control\" over Taliban is more often a case where Pakistan actually having scant choice in the matter. Going along with Taliban afforded Pakistan advantages such as mujahidin's to deploy against India. The \"new\" Taliban has supplanted Pakistan's role of an intermediary by dealing directly as it is doing with China or via Qatar or Turkey. The withdrawal is an economic catastrophe for Pakistan as a new refugee influx looks very likely. However most importantly, billions of dollars of money that flowed from the West and was gained by Pakistan as direct or \"gray\" exports via trade to a modernizing Afg will now disappear. The West looking to find a whipping boy for its \"failure\" will look at \"punishing\" Pakistan economically via sanctions that will push its tottering economy towards total economic collapse. The West may also indulge in realpolitik to encourage movements such as TTP - potentially causing massive bloodshed and instability. The insurgency last time even as TTP was being droned by the US and squatted over Afg was intense, this new one will be magnitudes of order more severe - and with no aid from the west. Pakistan with an ideologically conservative society and rampant poverty unfortunately presents fertile grounds for this. Instability will also mean drying up of Chinese projects and connectivity that were hitherto progressing under the thankless shade of NATO in Afg. Most critically however - as the 10s of thousands of Pakistani mujahidins who fought for Taliban return to KPK and Waziristan, they will naturally want to put in place in Pakistan the same system as they put next door. Pashtun eyes on both sides will again look hungrily at Peshawar and Quetta. While Pakistan has used mujahidins in a calibrated manner in Kashmir, the challenge now will be holding the surge back. Given India's new nationalistic \"muscular response\" policy - this only means war with India becomes more likely than ever. Worst case scenario for Pakistan, the sub-continent and the world is the old nightmare of mad mullahs gaining power through a revolution - and by extension - Pakistan's nukes. For anyone wondering how a Afg-Pak conflict might go down, once the goodies start drying up in Kabul may read - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third\\_Anglo-Afghan\\_War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Anglo-Afghan_War) \\- this may play out, without of course the Brits, Sikhs, Gurkhas and Dogras at play.\n\nOverall, given a few years, I expect the world to clamor back to the US and its allies for security. Also given the upheavals that are going to go down in the backyards of US' main strategic rivals - Russia and China - stand to loose in the SCO sphere. So notwithstanding any spectacles of Taliban unfurling its banners over Kabul on the 9/11 anniversary, US stands to gain overall mid term with heightened risk of terrorist attacks - any such attack will mean pressure on Pakistan to deliver on the undeliverable. The biggest losers look to be sub-continental nations, with Pakistan and India facing the grimmest scenarios.\n\nFinally, let me also put up a long term view (completely ideal and hypothetical): the only solution to the Afghan issue is hinted at by the period under the Mughals where Afghanistan was split into three. Even now, a likely solution may involve a truly global military and diplomatic effort whereby the North goes to Stans, Western provinces to Iran and Eastern Pashtun provinces to Pakistan. The only catch however is that a super-large Pashtun population may again in turn alienate and cause resentment/separatism amongst Punjabi, Sindhi and Baloch populations of Pak.\n\nTl;dr - US withdrawal is likely infact going to strengthen it geo-politically while causing massive problems for the world at large but especially countries of the Indian subcontinent - politically the old \"clash of civilizations\"/xenophobic/right-wing dispensations will gain ground. Looking at historical patterns, the solution to contain the restive, war-like people of Afghanistan is to split the country along religio-ethnic lines and assimilate the regions into larger, stabler nations.", "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "emojis": [], "location": {"profile_location": null, "geo_location": null, "nlp_location": null, "final_location": null, "tier": null, "country": "India", "state": null, "city": null}, "sentiment": {"label": "negative", "score": -0.57}, "keywords": ["historical", "analysis", "afghan", "state", "role", "indian"], "aspects": [{"aspect": "mileage", "sentiment": "negative", "score": -0.57}, {"aspect": "performance", "sentiment": "negative", "score": -0.57}, {"aspect": "comfort", "sentiment": "negative", "score": -0.57}, {"aspect": "safety", "sentiment": "negative", "score": -0.57}, {"aspect": "design", "sentiment": "negative", "score": -0.57}, {"aspect": "price", "sentiment": "negative", "score": -0.57}], "intent": "complaint", "embedding": null, "embedding_model": null, "processed_at": "2025-10-03T17:36:37.648079Z", "source_id": "reddit:28b6ee569c66", "target_vehicle": "MG Hector", "vehicle_category": "Mid-size SUV"}

Please tell me guys!. \n\n\n\n\n\nThere’s  guy I have a crush on — let’s call him Hector, and his friend Varo. I never had the courage to approach him directly, so — quietly, secretly — I followed him from a fake I saw him at the college farewell. That day, our eyes met — accidentally.\n\n{I can't tell whether all of this is just a series of coincidences… or something written by destiny.\nI want  you guys to tell me — from your perspective.}\n\nPoint One: I had failed a year, which pushed my academic timeline back. Oddly enough, that delay placed me in the exact same final year as him. A twist of fate I never saw coming.If I hadn’t failed that year, I wouldn’t have ended up in the same final year as him — and I never would’ve seen him on the day of the farewell.\n\nPoint Two: At one point, Hector blocked me. Then I was  desperate to feel connected, I followed 18 of his friends — but only one responded. His name was Varo. Despite being a stranger, Varo helped me get unblocked, using a clever little trick that somehow worked. It felt… strange. Almost unreal.\n\nPoint Three: The very same day I first messaged Varo,  Hector also messages him after 1.5 months of silence  A coincidence? Or something more?\n\nPoint Four: One day, Varo told Hector, “There’s a girl who saw you at farewell. She likes you — a lot.” Hearing this, Hector asked for my ID. Normally, Varo always sends me screenshots and waits for my response before saying anything to Hector. But this time, without asking me, he just sent my ID and told him, “Here she is — send her a request.”\nIt was surreal. When Hector had blocked me, I never imagined that one day, he would follow me.\n\n\n\nPoint Five: A few days ago, I found out he’s seeing someone else.I found out from his friend that he isn’t dating her — he’s just seeing her.\n And strangely, I didn’t cry.\nMaybe because, deep down, a quiet part of me still believes… our story isn’t over.\nI don’t know why, but I feel something meaningful is waiting for us on convocation day.\n\nAnd now I wonder: were these just scattered coincidences?", "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "emojis": [], "location": {"profile_location": null, "geo_location": null, "nlp_location": null, "final_location": null, "tier": null, "country": "India", "state": null, "city": null}, "sentiment": {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.0}, "keywords": ["everything", "happening", "between", "crush", "destiny", "coincidence"], "aspects": [{"aspect": "infotainment", "sentiment": "neutral", "score": 0.0}], "intent": "query", "embedding": null, "embedding_model": null, "processed_at": "2025-10-03T17:36:37.649723Z", "source_id": "reddit:0c4418eea974", "target_vehicle": "MG Hector", "vehicle_category": "Mid-size SUV"}

My regular mechanic doesn’t deal with dash cams, so he referred me to someone in Santacruz. However, that guy didn’t even understand my query and just tried to sell me whatever he had.\n\nSo, I have two main questions:\n\t1.\tIs there a local mechanic in Mumbai who can install a high-quality dash cam that meets my requirements?\n\t2.\tIf he doesn’t have the exact model I need, can he at least understand my requirements and suggest the best setup for installation, regardless of where I buy the dash cam from?\n\nMoney is not an issue—I just want it done properly. We often travel at night, sometimes even past midnight, and I want a reliable dash cam for safety. Recently, we had an incident where someone suddenly jumped in front of our car and tried to extort money.

When traffic police arrived and confronted the contractor, his response was \"Padithe Padindi, ippudenti?\" (Translation for non-Telugu speakers: \"Whatever fell has fallen, what's the big deal now?\")\n\nEven more concerning: Traffic police mentioned this isn't the first incident of construction materials falling onto the road below. The contractor's casual attitude suggests they have zero regard for public safety.\n\nQuestions:\n1. Who's monitoring these construction sites?\n2. Why aren't there proper safety protocols in place?\n3. Do we really need to wait for a fatality before authorities take action?\n\n\n\nTLDR: Construction material from flyover falls on car, narrowly misses killing passenger, contractor doesn't care, apparently this has happened before.", "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "emojis": [], "location": {"profile_location": null, "geo_location": null, "nlp_location": "Hyderabad, India", "final_location": "Hyderabad, India", "tier": "Tier-1", "country": "India", "state": "Telangana", "city": "Hyderabad"}, "sentiment": {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.0}, "keywords": ["construction", "hammer", "orr", "kondapur", "flyover", "pierces"], "aspects": [{"aspect": "safety", "sentiment": "neutral", "score": 0.0}], "intent": "query", "embedding": null, "embedding_model": null, "processed_at": "2025-10-03T17:36:37.656636Z", "source_id": "reddit:82314e4a17f5", "target_vehicle": "MG Hector", "vehicle_category": "Mid-size SUV"}

Take a look at my 1991 Dodge Stealth R/T. First things first... [Pictures](http://imgur.com/a/VY7k3)\n\nBeware: Long sappy post.\n\nMy mom taught me to drive stick-shift at 13 years old. She always said that all of her children **will** learn to drive stick before they drive anything else. She revealed, when asked, that she liked stick-shift cars because \"if she couldn't *own* a racecar, she at least wanted it to *feel* like one.\"\n\nMy Dad has *owned* **87** cars in his life of 50 years. He is a gifted mechanic, moonlighting as one to support our family before and long after the divorce. I spent many weekends as a teen watching him wrench on cars that belonged to people I'd never know.\n\nI played racing games my whole life, I had countless supercar books in my room, I was primed and ready to be a car guy. But most of my life before I graduated high school was spent in a decidedly lower-middle class household. I started off driving an '02 Silverado that my oldest brother gifted me. Then a Chevy Cobalt that was my stepfather's, Followed by a Suzuki Grand Vitara left to my mother when her mother passed. I was never gonna be the guy with the 2012 Challenger or 2008 Cummins, or any higher end (for high-school kids) car. I knew and understood (and had made peace with) why, but it never once blunted my desire.\n\nSo I graduated high-school and went straight to the military. When I arrived in NC, I bought a brand new 2014 Fiesta SE. Fixed, low interest rate, got them to knock a grand off sticker, and I didn't have to starve to make the payments. I made them very comfortably, even at my low (E-2) salary. When I told these facts to my superiors, they recognized me as an adult, not bowing to my desires to buy a brand new sports car with a life-draining interest rate/ car payment. I needed something reliable, cheap to own, and cheap to operate. I was successful in each category.\n\nNo matter how satisfied I was with the financial aspects of my vehicle, I was always left wanting when it came to the status (or lack thereof) that it carried. I was always met with confused looks when I talked to the \"car guys\" and inevitably had to tell them what my ride was. Cocked heads and furrowed brows. Sometimes so much as a surprised \"Really?!\" Even after I deployed, I was saving up to pay for my wedding in cash. To pay for my furniture, mine and my wife's travel, our house, ** everything **. The project car would have to wait still.\n\nSo we arrive to about a month ago. I had just left for a (terrible) month long training event. My wife and I had been diligently saving money and making triple car payments (dual income, no kids) for well over a year, and we had both decided that it was best to wait to buy another car. So I texted her one night and said that we are in an excellent position financially, to which she agreed and gave me the greenlight to look at some cars.\n\nI looked all over the Eastern Seaboard on craigslist for the month of May. I was convinced I was going to get a BMW 330CI M-sport. I was talked out of it, but continued the search still. I found a 1999 Cobra in VA for a really good price. Then, two days before I plan on leaving to look at it, the dude says it \"runs and drives great, but bring a car dolly.\" I was born ** at ** night, not ** last ** night. I continued searching. I wanted something weird, uncommon even. Just when I was telling my friend (who drives an RB26 Swapped 240SX) this, he says \"How about a VR4?\" I looked up from my phone (showing a 7M-GTE Mk.3 Supra and a '93 MR2 on craigslist) and said \"DSM?\" \"Yeah man. AWD, AWS, Twin turbo V6,\" he replied, \"you want weird and fast, that's the ticket.\" So, on a whim, my wife and I left at 5 A.M. to drive for 6 1/2 hours to Georgia.\n\nI arrive to find a young southern man who believed I was bluffing the entire time I was texting him updates on our position. We looked at the car, discussed every mod that was done in detail, reviewed a healthy and reassuring amount of paperwork (60K Guides, Engine and Trans rebuild receipts, etc.) and I finally asked to drive the car. I felt her rumble into life, depressing the clutch to the floorboard as I started her. I took her for a spin around the block and finally out on some windy country roads. For the first time in my life, I felt  what boost feels like. After 3.5k RPM's I was pinned to my seat. I was in love. I bought the car and drove it straight back, following my wife.\n\nThe car needs work. As an aviation mechanic, I'm getting my easel and whiteboards set up to take a methodical approach to maintenance. I have a full coolant flush and the diagnosing of a minor oil leak to do before I can go out and rag on the car. Then, a tune to regulate what needs to be regulated.\n\nI don't know if you guys care to read all of this stuff, ( you don't have to, pictures are up at the top ) but I cared enough to share my story with everyone. I hope you all enjoyed. Happy driving!\n\n**EDIT**: This took off a little more than I thought it would. So I'll treat you guys to the story of my very first \"car guy\" moment. My wife and I were 2 hours out from home on the interstate, She was leading in the Fiesta for multiple reasons (Car charger, GPS is better on her phone, she's more level-headed, but mostly to keep my leadfoot in check) and I was following her in the Stealth. I was being ginger (most of the time, save for on-ramps) and staying a ways back from my wife to keep the car healthy and cool. I noticed a new-generation Charger SXT coming up on my left. As they got closer, I notice this thing was jam full of a family of five, and the dad in the driver's seat is pointing at my car and talking. As they slowly overtook me, all the kids (the oldest of which couldn't have been more that 15) were smiling through the window at me. I smiled back and just enjoyed the moment. I was a little sad, though. I would have loved to have given them a show, however I wanted to be gentle with my new car. My mind told me, as they were passing me further and further, that I didn't want to blow her up. I didn't want to risk any damage. I sure as hell didn't want to get screened by the South Carolina State Troopers doing 90 in a (then) non-licensed, uninsured, and unregistered vehicle.\n\nBut my body had other plans. No sooner than I finished these worrisome thoughts, my left foot smashed the clutch down to the floorboard as my right hand snatched the shifter into 3rd. I depressed the gas to compensate for my upcoming RPM spike. From 2k RPM's to 4k RPM's, I was smack dab at the start of my boost curve. The car rocketed to life like a once dormant animal being startled awake by a threat. I saw my boost gauge start climbing in sync with my speed and RPM's and screamed past the Charger, shifting back into 5th close enough for the kids to hear that sweet turbo blow-off. As I slowed back to reasonable speeds and the Charger overtook me yet again, I was greeted by two of the kids clapping for me and the oldest giving me a thumbs up and a huge smile. I smiled like an idiot the rest of the way home, and still do when I think about it.", "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "emojis": [], "location": {"profile_location": null, "geo_location": null, "nlp_location": null, "final_location": null, "tier": null, "country": "India", "state": null, "city": null}, "sentiment": {"label": "positive", "score": 0.43}, "keywords": ["bought", "first", "project", "fun", "car", "life"], "aspects": [{"aspect": "performance", "sentiment": "positive", "score": 0.43}, {"aspect": "comfort", "sentiment": "positive", "score": 0.43}, {"aspect": "infotainment", "sentiment": "positive", "score": 0.43}, {"aspect": "design", "sentiment": "positive", "score": 0.43}, {"aspect": "price", "sentiment": "positive", "score": 0.43}, {"aspect": "service", "sentiment": "positive", "score": 0.43}], "intent": "praise", "embedding": null, "embedding_model": null, "processed_at": "2025-10-03T17:36:37.659820Z", "source_id": "reddit:d1d9594b8a52", "target_vehicle": "Maruti Grand Vitara", "vehicle_category": "Compact SUV"}

A few months back I purchased a used Acura RDX from my parents. No, not the new one that everyone likes, a 2015 model. The one that [Motor Trend](https://www.motortrend.com/cars/acura/rdx/2013/2013-acura-rdx-awd-verdict/) said “does everything well, but there is nothing that wows you, nothing that excites you, nothing that makes you eager to go for a drive.” Her name is Nancy 2 and I love her.    \nNow, admittedly the RDX was not my first choice in vehicle; but my Ford Focus was facing down its 4th transmission repair in 32,000 miles and my parents happened to be looking for a new car so the timing just worked out.  \nHow does it drive? Fine I guess. The 273 hp 3.5L V6 propels all 3,800 lbs of suburban domesticity to 60mph in the low 6 second range. Fast enough to send my phone flying off the dashboard as I merge onto another New Jersey highway but not so fast that I’d dare challenge an Ecoboost Mustang at a stoplight. Handling wise the RDX is surprisingly planted which allows me to take curves way faster than any reasonable person should expect but still plush enough to handle shitty north eastern roads with comfort and grace.  \nStyling? It... exists. It looks pretty much like every other black crossover on the road which makes it somewhat challenging to locate in crowded parking lots. It blends into traffic and turns no heads. It’s the automotive equivalent of a plain turkey sandwich with no mayo. Nobody will envy your lunch but nobody will bother you asking for a taste either.   \nThe second generation Acura RDX is an all around bland vehicle that delivers no surprises. It demands nothing of its driver and expects nothing in return.  \n&nbsp;  \nAnd I fucking love this thing.     \n&nbsp;   \nThe Acura RDX isn’t a car for the race track, though I’m sure it would be hilarious to try. The RDX is the ultimate road trip car. It’s reasonably fast and responsive when it needs to be. It’s quiet and comfortable on the highway. It’s large enough to fit four adults and their luggage for a week long getaway but small enough to park in the city. When I run out of room I’ve got a roof rack I can put even more shit on to. It’s dead reliable and has never left anyone in my family stranded or even had a single warranty claim. Fuel economy wise it averages a reasonable 25 mpg which while worse than the Focus it replaced isn’t so bad that I feel it in my wallet every month. The interior is well put together with soft touch materials in all of the places I would care to touch, and even some that I should never need to touch like the dashboard behind the steering wheel.  \nDid I mention the comfort? I’m going to talk about comfort again. In my old Focus I would really start feeling fatigued after about 5 hours on the road. In the RDX I can easily do 8-9 hours in a single stretch. The RDX just plows through endless highway miles like a frat bro shotgunning cheap beer. There’s no stopping it. It just rolls along like it’s nothing.  \n&nbsp;  \nAnd now I’m going to say something that might get me banned from r/cars... I think the crossover provides a much better form factor for a family car than a typical sedan.  \n&nbsp;   \nGranted, a lot of this comes down to the hatchback. I firmly believe any vehicle can be improved by the addition of a rear hatch and I think there are a lot of people who would agree with that. But why is it that so many enthusiasts will gush over the latest hatchback or wagon but turn up their nose at a crossover? Over what? A few extra inches of ground clearance? The lingering “soccer mom” image that comes with a family suv? Sure maybe a car gives you better “road feel” which I’m sure is great if your daily commute involves the Tail of the Dragon but for someone like me who spends 90% of my time in the car on the highway moving in a straight line being lower to the ground doesn’t seem all that beneficial. Plus the idea that a car must be sporty and have great feedback is a relatively recent idea if the barge sized slow meandering American cars of yesteryear are anything to go by. And looking around, many of these so called crossovers aren’t even that much bigger than their station wagon counterparts. The line between wagon and crossover becomes blurrier every day. If I park a Crosstrek next to an Impreza wagon how many laypeople would even know the difference? You know what, how about we just call crossovers “tallish wagons.”    \nMaybe I’m just biased having grown up in family of small SUVs, from my dad’s various Suzuki Sidekicks or Grand Vitaras, and Jeep Wranglers and Liberties, or my mom’s 04 Acura MDX (aka Nancy 1) but I’ve always appreciated the utility of a tallish wagon over a sedan. So while many people sit around and mourn the loss of sedans in a sea of crossovers I for one am excited to see all of the fun and interesting new tallish wagons entering the market.  \n\nTl;dr crossovers aren’t so bad.

My first test drive I ever did was in February 2024.\n\nI was a freshman at a medical college in India and I was yearning to drive a car. I had an Indian license, but the catch was, I wasn’t literate enough in driving a manual car, since I was in a hurry to get my license before college starts and I used my Gulf license as a foundation to get my Indian license (yes it is possible in India)\n\nIt was a boring weekend and I wanted to do something fun. Since I had no one to accompany me, I decided to go to a few dealerships and check out their new vehicles.\n\nAlthough there were multiple showrooms in my locality, I only had time to go to two: a VW dealer & a Suzuki dealer.\n\nThe VW dealer had a Virtus for test drive. However, since it was a manual, I was unable to test drive it, so I had to leave with a heavy heart.\n\nAcross the VW dealer, stood the Suzuki dealer, in all its glory.\n\nIn India, Suzuki (better known as Maruti Suzuki) has two dealerships; “Arena”, for their affordable cars, and “NEXA”, for their premium offerings.\n\nIt so happened that the Suzuki dealer was a NEXA one, which meant it had better cars to drive.\n\nI managed to cook up a story and convince the salesperson to let me test drive and luckily, they did have a Grand Vitara for test drive.\n\nThis Grand Vitara was different from the global version, as it was exclusively released for Southeast Asia & South Africa. \n\nIt had two engines: a 1.5 liter “mild hybrid” 4 pot making 103 hp and 138 Nm of torque, and a 1.5 liter pure hybrid 3 pot making a combined 114 hp (91 from the engine & 79 from the battery)\n\nThe one I test drove was the top variant of the mild hybrid, which came with a 6 speed automatic and surprisingly, paddle shifters, although it had no drive modes. Drive modes were exclusive to the 4WD “Allgrip” variant, which only came in a 5 speed manual.\n\nSafe to say, the engine felt adequately powerful, even though it makes only 103 horses, and for a compact SUV, the seating position’s really good and it comes with a boatload of features, given it’s the top trim. I also loved the petrol engine in this car, since I’m biased to diesels in India, due to their higher torque, making the car feel a bit powerful.\n\nThankfully I didn’t crash the car either, given Indian drivers are particularly reckless, especially the public transport drivers.

Hey, I’m usually pretty good about this stuff and have done a lot of reading so far, but looking for other opinions or maybe if I have any blind spots in my search. Basics are, I live in Colorado and currently drive a 2011 4Runner that I like and enjoy, but I don’t enjoy the monthly payment. So I’m looking for something similar that I can buy in cash, up to about $7,500. Idea is to have it last 2 years and around 30,000 miles with no major repair issues until I’m ready to upgrade. AWD or part time 4wd is a must, locking differential preferred. Needs to be an SUV or crossover, not picky, I don’t do hard core off-roading but do drive to fishing spots and trail heads that require 4x4 and decent ground clearance. Easy answer would be to get a 4th gen 4Runner, and those are in my budget when you get into the 180k mile range. Which I’m ok with if I find a well maintained example, would like the V8 with a timing belt history, but that’s stretching  budget a little. I do not want a Subaru, they may fit the bill but in my price range they’ll all need timing belts serviced and have the head gasket issues, been burnt by that is the past so not interested. Other things I have considered in no particular order: \n\nGrand Cherokee WK (or Commander) in 120-150k mile range – capable and the Hemi would be a nice change from my 4Runner, I don’t buy into all the internet hype but am still warry of the reliability \n\nXterra early years in the 150k mile range – Not super high on this one although it’s certainly a capable truck, am aware of the SMOD issue \n\n2007-8ish Suzuki Grand Vitara 100-125K miles – really like these being around $5k, would get the Suzuki 2.7 not the GM engine, also has a low range 4wd \n\nGX 470 seem to be out of my budget and concerned about the air suspension reliability, timing belt also\n\nLC100 Land Cruiser – tops the list with the Grand Vitara, several in my range all 200k plus, confident in their reliability, would check timing belt, all are pre 2003 so not sure how I’d like the 4 speed vs 5 speed models that are out of budget on road trips, Sequoia fits here a little too but never much appealed to me, could get newer and less miles than the LC \n\nVolvo XC90 – not looked too much into this, seem the transmissions may have issues \n\nFord Escape – Hybrid seem to have a decent reputation but haven’t done much looking \n\nChevy Tahoe 2007+ – Like the room and the familiarity with the platform, most are +180k miles in my range so getting questionable \n\n\n\nAny thoughts on what I’ve listed or things I haven’t considered are greatly appreciated. I know cars at 200k miles and reliability don’t really go hand in hand, and service history at this point may make more of a difference than brand/model, but there’s got to be something out there I can squeeze a few years and 30k miles out of. I may be dumb for getting out of the 4Runner, which I can afford, but it will be worth it financially if I snag something that just needs fluid changes for a couple years.

I've been looking for a 4WD/AWD SUV or pickup to use as a second car that will stand up to some light off-roading - not rock crawling or anything, just rough/rocky dirt trails and rolling out onto the beach. Leaning towards SUV because I need something with a back seat, and most of the pickups I come across on CL don't have one. I'm in the northeastern US.\n\nObviously in this price range I'm looking at older, well-worn, higher-mileage cars - as long as they run decent and aren't rotting out or otherwise on the verge of a trip to the scrap heap, I'm good. I have some candidates and wanted to hear from anyone who has experience to share with these, as well as suggestions for anything I don't have on the list.\n\n* 2001-2004 Nissan Pathfinder/Infiniti QX4 - these seem to be the best bang for the buck in my price range, with a good number available. These have the venerable and powerful VQ35DE, proven 4WD setup, good overall reliability history, and decent aftermarket. I found a rare one last week that sounded great on paper (2002 SE 5spd with low mileage, ran great, everything worked, etc) but found the frame rails/rad support/suspension components to all be heavily rusted, so I had to pass on it. I'm open to automatics as well but it seems this generation has a common trans issue where reverse stops working.\n\n* 1999-2006 Suzuki Vitara/Grand Vitara/XL7/Chevy Tracker - like the Pathfinder, these are capable 4x4s and seem to have held up pretty well in terms of reliability. I had an '03 Grand Vitara which was great until my ex destroyed it, in about 1.5 years of ownership it only needed a clutch master cylinder. I know with Suzuki out of the US car market they can be tough to find parts for these days, but the upside there is that these now have even less resale value, so I can get one even cheaper than I would have a few years ago.\n\n* 2003-2006 Kia Sorento - these have always been intriguing to me because of their body-on-frame construction and reportedly solid 4x4 setup, but they have some inherent problems and maintenance issues (flawed crank pulley bolt design, 60k timing belt interval) that concern me.\n\n* 2002-2007 Chevy Trailblazer/GMC Envoy/Buick Rainier/etc - these are a dime a dozen in my price range, some of which seem to be in good shape, but I'm not sure of their reliability or off-road capabilities. I'm mostly interested in the standard-wheelbase models with the 4.2L I6.\n\n* 1991-2001 Jeep Cherokee (XJ) - this should probably be higher on my list, but unfortunately most of the ones I can find under 3 grand are either rust buckets, beaten beyond reason, or shittily modded - some all of the above. I have owned two of these already so I know what to expect, but considering the age and condition of most of these now, I'm not sure I want another one.\n\n* 1996-2002 Toyota 4Runner - I know these are a great option but like the XJ, it's hard to find one in remotely good condition for under $3k since they hold their resale so well.", "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "emojis": [], "location": {"profile_location": null, "geo_location": null, "nlp_location": null, "final_location": null, "tier": null, "country": "India", "state": null, "city": null}, "sentiment": {"label": "positive", "score": 0.43}, "keywords": ["durable", "beater", "under", "recommendations", "looking", "awd"], "aspects": [{"aspect": "mileage", "sentiment": "positive", "score": 0.43}, {"aspect": "performance", "sentiment": "positive", "score": 0.43}, {"aspect": "comfort", "sentiment": "positive", "score": 0.43}, {"aspect": "design", "sentiment": "positive", "score": 0.43}, {"aspect": "price", "sentiment": "positive", "score": 0.43}, {"aspect": "service", "sentiment": "positive", "score": 0.43}], "intent": "query", "embedding": null, "embedding_model": null, "processed_at": "2025-10-03T17:36:37.674980Z", "source_id": "reddit:33183251ec98", "target_vehicle": "Maruti Grand Vitara", "vehicle_category": "Compact SUV"}

Hello! I’m currently looking for a used car to buy hopefully this summer. I don’t know a lot about cars so I’m hoping someone can give me recommendations here.

However the car is very rusted and has oil leaks and needs a new catalytic converter/exhaust overhaul, which would’ve ended up costing me more than I’ve paid for the car, so she’s on her way out.\n\nI’m currently a college student and only drive my car a few days a week to work and school. The two years that I’ve had it, I’ve only put 13,000 miles on it total, so as you can see I don’t drive a lot.\n\nI live in Massachusetts, so driving in the snow is a given. I would love a car with 4WD, and have it look similar to my Suzuki (like a boxy SUV if you know what I mean?) but of course looks aren’t everything to me lol as long as it’s reliable. If anyone can recommend me cars around 15k$ or lower that are reliable, have 4WD, and will last a long time with me only driving like 7k miles on it a year, please let me know!!!

Also considering 2008 Suzuki Grand Vitara or XL7.... Both the Vibe and sx4 are 180k miles, and both are manual transmission. So far as I know, the sx4 has had no major service but will need tires soon. The Vibe has a very new clutch. Both cars are $3900 OBO, and for sale in the Western USA. At this time that's the extent of what I know about them.\n\n*Edit: I just remembered that I was told the Vibe had a problem where the autolocking for the hatch drained the battery, and had to be left unplugged in order to avoid that. The key still works on it, but it doesn't lock/unlock with the rest of the doors when using the FOB.\n\nBut there are also a 2008 Suzuki XL7 and Grand Vitara for sale some distance from me. The XL7 has v6 auto, 4wd or AWD (not sure which), 157k miles, no major service I know about, and is $3600.\n\nThe Grand Vitara is also v6 auto, 4wd, 129k miles, no major service listed, and $4000.\n\nThe problem with the XL7 and G. Vitara is that they are 3 hours drive from me and I don't have a car. I think I could make it work if the owners were amicable to working with me; but the two cars are local to me and would be easier to purchase, have inspected, etc.\n\nI like camping in remote places, so the Vitara is especially appealing, but I've had sellers not respond when I tell them where I live and ask if they're willing to work with me so I'm not hopeful. And the vibe is slightly more appealing than the sx4 because I'm worried about finding parts when the sx4 has problems in the future - even though the sx4 has selectable awd/4wd, which would be better for my outdoor excursions...\n\nThe sx4 was first listed 2 months ago. The other 3 vehicles have only been listed a week or less.\n\nSo what do you think? I'm looking at the Vibe and test driving tomorrow (7/21). I always dig into service records if I can. What other questions do you recommend I ask? What problems should I look out for? I will only buy a car after my mechanic inspects it (I have trusted mechanics in both locations so have the SUV's inspected is doable if the owners work with me.) Are there any 'heads-up's' you would give a mechanic to look closely at, concerning any of these vehicles?\n\nEdit (7/21): For anyone who's curious, I test drove the Vibe and it seems solid and runs well. Clutch pedal is stiff but shifts clean. Didn't realize it has manual windows and no cruise control, almost no features at all actually. Airbag light is on, although a dealership replaced the passenger airbag at 140k. AC doesn't blow cold air, but the compressor does come on so it might just need charged. Guy said he'd go down to $3500 because of the AC. It might have had the timing belt done at some point, he wasn't sure. I am trying to schedule an inspection with my mechanic to see what other service it might need before I counter with anything lower.

Well, hello there! As someone who very much falls into the 'knows-jack-about-cars-but-urgently-needs-to-buy-a-used-car' category, I thought this sub may be the ideal place to post my queries :) Many thanks in advance to the kind strangers of reddit who may take some time out of their day to help guide me in this quest!\n\nSome geographical info - we live in a small country in the Balkans, which means two main things: roads are definitely not the best and the used car market, while not horrible, is considerably worse than in other countries in Europe (think not that many options on the market, people selling only once they've driven their car to beyond 250,000 kilometers and then selling at exorbitant prices, cars potentially tampered with, etc.). \n\nWithin this context, we are looking to buy a 2nd hand car, primarily for city use, but with decent off-road capabilities, and also good for the occasional long-haul road trip (think crossing the Balkans by car). We have a preference for Japanese cars, but are flexible. We've somewhat narrowed it down to the following models:\n\n* Suzuki Jimny, approx. 15 years old, approx. 150,000 kilometers, selling for 9k. \n* Toyota Rav4 - open to all models from 2005 onwards, that have a decent price-to-mileage ratio, as we've heard great things about this car and we know Toyota is reliable. Problem is that most of the RAVs around here that are being sold second hand have anywhere between 230,000 - more than 300,000 kilometers on them. \n* Mazda CX - 5, most models we've seen range from around 2010 - 2015, almost all cost more than 10k, almost all have more than 200,000 kilometers on them.\n* Suzuki Grand Vitara - similarly to the RAVs, most 2nd hand ones have lots of mileage accrued, although you can find more recent models available, at the same price point for an older RAV (I also like the 2-door, smaller Vitara, but not many of those on the market). \n* Suzuki SX4 - generally you can find some for a very decent price, and not with as much mileage, but, well, they are a bit underwhelming, lol. Although I understand that may not be an important factor here, hehe. \n* Dacia Duster - many of these rigs around, quite popular here since Dacia is a regional producer, but I've heard they're not as good as the others listed above.\n\nAny tips, thoughts, recs, more than welcome :) My main issue is that I can't necessarily understand whether it's best to go for a well-known and trusted model with more mileage on it, even if older, or go for something newer with less mileage even if not considered as good (e.g. RAV4 v. Jimny, have heard that the former is way better as a car than the latter). \n\nThanks so much in advance!\n\nP.S. I feel that car prices have generally inflated terribly, resulting in prices of used car approximating what you would pay for a new one a few years ago. Alas, we cannot afford a brand new car at the moment, so we play with what we have. I'd just hate to buy an expensive, used car, with more than 250,000 kilometers on it, just to have it be problematic down the road (e.g. the used Mazdas here are consistently pricey, whereas you can find relatively economic RAV4s - I'm not sure if this reflects on the quality of the car or not).", "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "emojis": [], "location": {"profile_location": null, "geo_location": null, "nlp_location": null, "final_location": null, "tier": null, "country": "India", "state": null, "city": null}, "sentiment": {"label": "positive", "score": 0.43}, "keywords": ["advice", "sought", "used", "car", "model", "buy"], "aspects": [{"aspect": "mileage", "sentiment": "positive", "score": 0.43}, {"aspect": "performance", "sentiment": "positive", "score": 0.43}, {"aspect": "design", "sentiment": "positive", "score": 0.43}, {"aspect": "price", "sentiment": "positive", "score": 0.43}], "intent": "query", "embedding": null, "embedding_model": null, "processed_at": "2025-10-03T17:36:37.692323Z", "source_id": "reddit:9a942043241b", "target_vehicle": "Maruti Grand Vitara", "vehicle_category": "Compact SUV"}

Okay so after driving a petrol car for nearly a decade we brought home a CNG. Initially we went to Nexa/Toyota to check out the strong hybrid versions but the people at both the places somehow convinced us to buy the CNG versions (maybe because the strong hybrid versions are exempted from road tax in UP, idk why they pressed so hard). Anyone CNG felt like a more sound decision. We had all the features that we needed for a significantly less price (including extra discounts )compared to the strong hybrid versions. \n\nHowever, we are nomads in the world of CNG cars. We don’t really know if this was really a sound decision. \nWe don’t know how to take care of a CNG car.\nWe don’t know how to run it till it’s first service. \nWe don’t know the extent to which we can push it.\n\nTherefore, I have some questions.\n\n1. We do know that it is cheap to run and as a result I have already put 700 Kms on it (just) within a period of 4 days. It is a problem? Will this affect the engine, or the fuel efficiency? \n\n2. Tried to keep it under 60 kmph but my senior drove it once for a fair stretch of 6-7 km and drove it on the third and fourth gear only, taking it beyond 80 kmph. The RPM was past 3 on third gear and we were going 60 kmph. I am sure it wouldn’t have caused any harm but still do I need to worry? (He also stalled it for like 100 times)\n\n3. We have driven it on CNG mostly. Someone said that I should drive it on petrol for first few weeks. Should I?\n\n4. I have heard alot of people talk about the pressure at CNG pumps. I have BPCL right next to my apartment. The first time I got the cylinder full, it was from a IGL pump which our dealer suggested (also gave us vouchers). Second time I got it from the nearby BPCL pump. This time the cylinder depleted very quickly. I only drove it for like 160 km. Third time I went to BPCL again. This time I got the cylinder full, paid the same amount and when I drove off I noticed that my meter showed 1/6th-1/8th of the cylinder empty. What is this?  \n\n5. I was driving on a jam packed road and I was on CNG. On the last point. I was low on petrol too. I thought I would make it home with the amount I was left with (using the petrol logic) but no. It quickly went empty within minutes. Very quick compared to other points.

My main priorities are:\n\nMileage: Something that’s fuel-efficient and easy on the pocket.\n\nMaintenance: Affordable servicing and ease of access to spare parts.\n\nComfort: Prefer a good sitting posture (SUV-like), as I currently own a Renault Duster. Going for a smaller hatchback feels like a downgrade in this aspect.\n\n\nI’m drawn to the Grand Vitara for its CNG option and practicality. However, I’m wondering if it’s still a solid choice in 2024. Are there better alternatives in the same price range that offer similar mileage, comfort, and low running costs?\n\nLooking forward to your inputs, especially if you’ve owned or driven this car.

I m a 25M, and last August, I bought my first car. Technically, it was my second car my first was a 2019 Hyundai i20 which I bought second-hand.\n\nWhile I was looking to buy a new car a close uncle suggested to my father that we should go for a Maruti Suzuki Brezza or Swift right from the start. I was actually more interested in the Grand Vitara if we were considering Suzuki he even contacted the RM at MS Arena to show us the Brezza. After talking to him for about 30 minutes my father convinced me that we should buy the LXI variant of the Brezza.\n\nKnowing that I was the one paying for the car, with my father helping me out with Rs. 1.5 lakh.\n\nHowever after about an hour I convinced my father to also check out other dealers like Hyundai and Tata since they were nearby. We went to the Hyundai dealership and saw the Venue but I was more drawn to the Creta EX variant. Unfortunately the MS dealer started calling my father repeatedly which cut our visit short we only got to see the Venue. Which I didn’t like. \n\nEventually my father was convinced by the MS dealer and decided on the Brezza I suggested we at least go for the ZXi or ZXi Plus but he wouldn’t budge. In the end we bought the Brezza VXi.\n\nFour months later I started to hate the car. I’m not exactly sure why it’s just not very fun to drive. It lacks features, and the mileage isn’t impressive either. For context, my friend’s Verna gives 13–14 km/l in the city, while mine gives just 14.\n\nNow I’m thinking of selling it—either to get another car or maybe not get one at all if my parents won’t support the idea. I don’t enjoy paying for this car anymore.\n\nAll of this started when I drove my friend’s Slavia 1.0 and the Honda City.", "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "emojis": [], "location": {"profile_location": null, "geo_location": null, "nlp_location": null, "final_location": null, "tier": null, "country": "India", "state": null, "city": null}, "sentiment": {"label": "negative", "score": -0.57}, "keywords": ["need", "help", "decision", "last", "august", "bought"], "aspects": [{"aspect": "mileage", "sentiment": "negative", "score": -0.57}, {"aspect": "performance", "sentiment": "negative", "score": -0.57}, {"aspect": "design", "sentiment": "negative", "score": -0.57}, {"aspect": "service", "sentiment": "negative", "score": -0.57}], "intent": "query", "embedding": null, "embedding_model": null, "processed_at": "2025-10-03T17:36:37.712552Z", "source_id": "reddit:bf9f10433527", "target_vehicle": "Maruti Grand Vitara", "vehicle_category": "Compact SUV"}

It's a really nice SUV. You can pick these up in the second market for almost R50k to R70k less than what you would be paying for a brand new one. \n\nRide quality and interior quality of the \"L\" model is pretty good. There are quite a lot of plastic trims in the second and third rows but I wouldn't make too much fuss about it. \n\n\"L\" model comes with a lot features like adaptive cruise control and the 360° camera, which makes it easier for day to day use of the vehicle. The camera is a must since this vehicle is quite big. The camera quality is also crisp and clear. The infotainment screen is amazing. There's no lag especially if you are using Android Auto...Google Maps are very clear and easily usable. \n\nThat engine is really something. It packs a lot of punch. Also it's very responsive and to an extend fun to drive. But since it's an SUV, there is a fair amount of body roll. The engine makes you want to drive this is as if it is a 3 series or a hot hatch but if you have a family in there, they won't like that at all. \n\nNegatives:\nThe Sony sound system in the \"L\" is ok. It does a fairly ok job but it is not the usual Sony quality you would expect. Another grip I have with the XUV700 is the lack of a proper blindspot monitoring system. I was happy with the old school mirror check. But what the \"L\" model does is whenever you turn, you get a camera feed pop up in your instrument cluster from the side mirror cameras. I feel this is a bit gimmicky and would prefer the tried and test BSM indicator in the side mirrors. Fuel consumption seems to be quite horrible. It seems like this SUV averages around over 10L/100km, which is quite ridiculous. The last gripe I have with this SUV is the lack of a load cover fitted directly from the manufacturer. So if you go shopping and decide to drop the last row seats, your shopping items can be seen through the back windows.  Haval H6 and Tiggo 8 Pro come with a load cover. In SA, a load cover is a must and Mahindra must make a plan for this to be installed on all the XUV700. I mean if you going to work, you need a space to put your laptop hidden. \n\nBut otherwise this is an amazing SUV. I would suggest finding the \"L\" model in the second hand market. Some of them come with additional extras such as side steps, tow bar, protective matte film over the large infotainment screen (this does help reduce glares and keeps the screen clean to an extent). To be honest, I would probably pick AX7 L over Haval H6, Chery Tiggo 8 Pro and even some of the mainstream competitions from Toyota and VW.", "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "emojis": [], "location": {"profile_location": null, "geo_location": null, "nlp_location": null, "final_location": null, "tier": null, "country": "India", "state": null, "city": null}, "sentiment": {"label": "positive", "score": 0.43}, "keywords": ["was", "recently", "one", "these", "here", "really"], "aspects": [{"aspect": "mileage", "sentiment": "positive", "score": 0.43}, {"aspect": "performance", "sentiment": "positive", "score": 0.43}, {"aspect": "comfort", "sentiment": "positive", "score": 0.43}, {"aspect": "infotainment", "sentiment": "positive", "score": 0.43}, {"aspect": "design", "sentiment": "positive", "score": 0.43}], "intent": "query", "embedding": null, "embedding_model": null, "processed_at": "2025-10-03T17:36:37.717656Z", "source_id": "youtube:954aef19eb23", "target_vehicle": "Mahindra XUV700", "vehicle_category": "Premium SUV"}

FRP material(is very strong) is used for tail gate door, which is quite common in high end German cars like BMW as well.\n3. The Automatic engine on/off on complete stop of car is actually quite intelligent. It doesn't switch off the engine if there are immediate consecutive stops(as in very tight bumper to bumper slow moving traffic) in very short distance. That is why it doesn't turn the engine on during the when you try to disable the feature when engine is in off state.

It's a BS4 diesel, so I’ve never really had to deal with DPF issues or the complexities of BS6 tech. The Brezza gives me an average of 16 kmpl and is mostly used for local runs.\n\nNow, I’m looking for a secondary car mainly for weekend getaways and long tours. I’ve narrowed it down to the XUV700, as it ticks almost all the boxes for me. Honestly, the features are almost the same as what I’ve been using with the Brezza — just the bare minimum that I’m comfortable with. The XUV700's comfort and long-distance capability seem perfect for what I need.\n\nThe real dilemma is choosing between the petrol and diesel variants. I know the diesel has that great torque and efficiency, but my main concern is the DPF issues with BS6 diesels. Since my Brezza was a BS4 car, I never had to worry about DPF clogging or needing to do long highway runs just to clear it out.\n\nConsidering my Brezza is MT and mainly used for local runs, I’m wondering if the XUV700 MX Petrol MT would be a good option to avoid potential DPF headaches. I know the petrol variant might not match the diesel’s fuel efficiency, but given my primary usage, it seems practical.\n\nSo, for those who own an XUV700 (or similar BS6 diesel cars) — how bad are the DPF issues, really? Is it something that can be managed with proper usage, or should I just go for the petrol to avoid potential headaches?\n\nAny insights would be greatly appreciated!", "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "emojis": [], "location": {"profile_location": null, "geo_location": null, "nlp_location": null, "final_location": null, "tier": null, "country": "India", "state": null, "city": null}, "sentiment": {"label": "positive", "score": 0.43}, "keywords": ["sir", "currently", "own", "brezza", "zdi", "has"], "aspects": [{"aspect": "mileage", "sentiment": "positive", "score": 0.43}, {"aspect": "performance", "sentiment": "positive", "score": 0.43}, {"aspect": "comfort", "sentiment": "positive", "score": 0.43}, {"aspect": "design", "sentiment": "positive", "score": 0.43}], "intent": "query", "embedding": null, "embedding_model": null, "processed_at": "2025-10-03T17:36:37.720992Z", "source_id": "youtube:2993a7e7fb52", "target_vehicle": "Mahindra XUV700", "vehicle_category": "Premium SUV"}

The car has been faultless to fault and has never ever given even a small problem in all my travels. Before this I had a 2002 Scorpio ( the initial lot ) and it was faultlessly reliable as well. I plan to keep the XUV for the full 15 years and then probably buy a ScorpioN. Yes, Toyota is faultlessly good, but they are hopelessly overpriced now and the others are catching up. So to doubt if the XUV 700 will last 10 years is in my opinion completely unfounded.

I have been all over India from Ladakh to Kanyakumari and Dwarka to Arunachal. Just recently I did a trip from Thane to Pench taking the Samruddhi highway taking a flat 11 hours net. The car has been faultless to fault and has never ever given even a small problem in all my travels. Before this I had a 2002 Scorpio ( the initial lot ) and it was faultlessly reliable as well. I plan to keep the XUV for the full 15 years and then probably buy a ScorpioN. Yes, Toyota is faultlessly good, but they are hopelessly overpriced now and the others are catching up. So to doubt if the XUV 700 will last 10 years is in my opinion completely unfounded.

Safety features was high on my list.  The Seltos EX has a boatload of significant modern safety features I was looking for.  The Forward Collision detection and assist, Blindspot detection and assist, Rear Cross-Traffic detection, Automatic Emergency Braking, to name a few.  It is very feature rich value.  And although I was diligent about seeing that all these cars had front and rear range sensors, It escaped me on the Seltos (she was starting school in a week 😲).   With all the great features and technology - it does not have basic sensors (available for decades) to alert you if a nearby obstacle is front or back of you.  I was a little dumbfounded, with all advance feature it has, and this absence.

I use Alcazar as a 5 seater. \nBest thing I love about Alcazar is the automatic torque converter diesel engine. Nobody can match Hyundai's level of smoothness. It feels like driving a petrol car. I even considered Jeep Compass but the premiumness and gadgets of Alcazar really impressed me. \nI did a short speed test and I couldn't get a chance to go beyond 176 kmph as there were vehicles in front of me. \nI always drive in sports mode and I just love it.

It is the most powerful MPV in the country. Displacement makes all the difference.

Of course some safety tech is important like numerous airbags, but those tech, you don't use everyday (or don't want to use for that matter as it equates to accidents). The tech used daily though are just lacking. 6.7\" touchscreen? No backup camera for the mid-tier variant? At 1.4M, that should've been standard. The top-tier is what, 1.8M? \n\nThe \"It's a Toyota\" monicker will go old soon if they don't try to up their game. At those pricepoints, what will stop people from getting a Geely, a Tiggo, or a Maxus that offer state-of-the-art tech and similar safety features, plus ridiculous warranties? Or cheaper 7-seater options from other Japanese brands with more tech? Parts availability? It has come to a point now that all major Japanese, Korean, and even Chinese car brands have parts available everywhere, even at Shopee, believe it or not. It's not exclusive to Toyota anymore. \n\nI am not a Toyota hater. My family's first car is an old Corona. My father is now driving an old Toyota. It is always a brand that's close to my heart.

Modern cars are designed to crumple in an accident to protect the occupants of the car. You have to remember that when your car is doing 90 kph and you hit a brick wall, that forward energy has to be dissipated somehow. In the days of heavy cars of days gone by, the car survived much of the impact, but the passengers didn’t. The occupants were ejected out of the vehicle or slammed into unforgiving dashboards or steering wheels made out of steel, no padding. Then some of the car companies started coming up with ways that the car would crumple in an accident and that would reduce the inertia to the passenger in the seatbelt. Your car would be destroyed, but you may walk away with minimal injury. As cars became smaller, they had to come up with new ways that the car would crumple, they came up with crumple zones and hence the reason why you might feel like in grand vitara that sheets of body are thin but they are designed to take crumble affect while in accident so that you stay safe no matter the car is destroyed to pieces.", "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "emojis": [], "location": {"profile_location": null, "geo_location": null, "nlp_location": null, "final_location": null, "tier": null, "country": "India", "state": null, "city": null}, "sentiment": {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.0}, "keywords": ["shocking", "most", "people", "don", "understand", "why"], "aspects": [{"aspect": "comfort", "sentiment": "neutral", "score": 0.0}, {"aspect": "design", "sentiment": "neutral", "score": 0.0}], "intent": "query", "embedding": null, "embedding_model": null, "processed_at": "2025-10-03T17:36:37.853063Z", "source_id": "youtube:2c1a0a201b7d", "target_vehicle": "Maruti Grand Vitara", "vehicle_category": "Compact SUV"}
