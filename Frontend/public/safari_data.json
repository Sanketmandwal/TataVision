He told me that I have won a Tata Safari worth \u20b912 lakh and 80 thousand because of some flipkart contest and I can either have the Car or the money wired to me. For the former, he asked me to submit \u20b910 thousand in a bank account. And for the former, he asked me to mail the scanned copies of my Pan Card, Bank Passbook and a cancelled cheque.\n\nEverything was literal red alarm. I told him the blunt truth that I knew he was a scamster who's trying to thug money from innocent people. After this, he started making excuses that the prize and the contest is legitimate. I did not budge and he started abusing me. I cut the call after that.\n\nI ordered something from flipkart a few days ago and it was not delivered, all thanks to a shitty courier service. I think the delivery boys are selling consumer's contact details to these shady third parties.",

This achievement highlights the growing adoption of EVs among Indian consumers.\n\nA key factor is the lower operating cost of the Punch EV compared to its petrol variant. For example, a full charge of the 25 kWh battery providing 315 km range costs around \u20b9200, while the petrol Punch requires approximately \u20b91,670 worth of fuel to cover the same distance.\n\nThe Punch EV's sales success signifies increasing consumer awareness about the environmental benefits of zero-emission electric mobility. EVs can potentially reduce air pollution levels, which remain a major health concern across Indian cities.\n\nWhile the Punch EV has a higher upfront price than petrol models, its running costs and eco-friendly nature appear to resonate with buyers. As EV adoption grows, it could contribute to India's sustainability goals and efforts to mitigate climate change impacts.",

Guys, I m on a dilemma, Sitting on the fence to buy a new car.\n\nHere's the thing..\n\nMy car is nearing the tenth year. Driven 1.02 Lakh kms, a diesel ford figo 1st gen.The car has been very reliablez timely services, except a major injector failure which shot my purse and post that it has been trouble free ever since.Though i would love to run the car, the car is already depreciated rapidly and due to fords exit, resale is almost nil.Due to the age and kms run, i feel resale is not going to fetch much of a money.\n\nThought of buying a car , but i do have an existing home loan with 10 lakhs as balance, which i m hopeful of completing it next year.\n\nBut with the upgrade itch starting, i was infact looking for options to upgrade ,but somehow felt that the home loan has to be finished first.\n\nOff late due to low interest rates for car loans, i m really thinking to purchase a car with such low interest rate as car prices are also being increased steadily.\n\nA hatchback of the same size today costs upwards of 10 lakhs on road.\n\nI do like to drive diesels much as my yearly run is almost 10k kms.Wanted an automatic too and hence looked at seltos diesel AT and now couldn't resist adding harrier to the list as well. As this is the only time i could buy and after this i might have several expenses upcoming like childs education etc, couldn't resist the temptation.\n\nI ll keep the car for ten years minimum and wont change it in between no matter what the advancements are \n\n \nI dilligently invest 50k per year for NPS and 20k across mutual funds and 3000 per month in PPF after all my payments like EMI, ETC ETC..I also maintain a reserve corpus of 3 months salary  which is not touched at all.\n\nWithout touching the above investments I can put a downpayment of 5 lakhs and rest on loan. Seltos means 16 lakhs OTR, harrier means 20 lakhs OTR.\n\nYearly maintenance, insurance etc is an another fixed expense i will definitely incur and considering all this, does it make sense to buy on a loan? I would really love to own a big car atleast once as i worked my a** off to pay this home loan in 5 years than the usual tenure of 10 years and would like to really treat myself with one good car..\n\nFellow redditors - Help me out..Knock me some sense if i m way too overambitious on spending 20 lakhs for a car \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44",

Ideally I'd be penny pinching, but I want to make sure my parents move out and about in an SUV and that's a dream I've wanted to fulfil for a long time. \n\nLooking at safety and value, I'm eyeing Harrier and Safari. The Safari last row could be useful if we went out with our dog (we can put the seats down and turn on the AC in the last row) so the dog is comfortable. \n\nBut my knowledge on cars and what to look out for isn't the best. Are there better options in this budget range?\n\nWhat do you wish you knew before buying an SUV? What advice do you have for a first time buyer?",

My apologies, I have been sitting on this rant for quite some time so please bear with me.\n\nI was looking at reviews of the Tata Harrier on YouTube and a video addressed a few cheapskate moves by Tata to bring the cost down by using shit quality interior lights, using shared grab handles of the cheaper tata hatchbacks, non-alignment of panels and exterior body cuts, inferior quality of the materials used etc.\n\nNow I'm fully aware that a few cost-cuts were necessary to bring it around the 15L price bracket in order to appeal the cost-over-quality market under this price segment but these were the little things costing a few thousand bucks and shoddy craftsmanship where they cut the corners. \n\nPeople commented shit like \"logo ko apne daesh ki cheezo mei nuks nikaalna hai, bahar ki nai, Tata ki gadiyan apne Indian army mei use karte hai, bahar nikalja India se saale\".\n\nI despise illiterate shits like these who bring everything down to nationalism. It's the small things that matter which Indian manufacturers totally ignore to simply get the prices down a little bit and earn a benevolent amount of profit. Majority of the people despite obviously wanting a cheaper product won't mind shelling off a little extra to get their money's worth, especially if already paying a few lacs. Either be it Indian phones or cars, manufacturers prioritise cheap shit over quality and craftsmanship and that's a fact. Imbeciles like these defend their products and the manufacturers have gotten accustomed of delivering inferior standard of quality. With this malpractice, majority of our products don't stand anywhere (in comparison) in the international market.",

Forget about bad interiors and driving dynamics \n\nTata can make engines with Cummins for their truck but can't make a 2L engine for safari and harrier \n\nMahindra can make military vehicles but can't make a small sportscar? \n\nMahindra has 2L mstallion engine which produces 200bhp and can be used for mass market decent sportscar\n\nIt's not about price as market is evolved and if people can spend 25 lakhs on pseudo suv like harrier then they'll buy a sedan too\n\nA 200bhp sedan at 25 lakhs would be steal deal when Mercedes A class has 140bhp at 55lakh\n\nSo what's the reason they can't even make mass market small sportscar?",

I've already compiled a list of [places and a path](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1VM3WsFAQAjup0y_tPwUJDESTGzftCDX_&usp=sharing). I'm more interested in culture, people, historic architecture and nature. \n\n\nI've been to India twice. Once Tamil Nadu, then Northeast India. I agree, this schedule is tight. This is only a preliminary list of all interesting places I could find. I'll be cutting down places and adding more places which are close to the cities I visit. Also, I love hectic schedules, they make me feel alive. Once I did 2000 km in 8 days in hike, buses, trains, bicycle and boats in my home country. I enjoy the journey as much as the destinations. Plus, I'm okay with sleeping in the trains between states. I'm hoping that might save some time (and money).\n\nI travel for historic architecture, natural scenaries, local food, people and their culture. So, recommend me on these as well!\n\nSome questions\n\n1. What do you think of the (overall) route shown in the map? Agra-North-Rajastan-Karnataka-Kerala? Do you recommend to go Agra-Rajastan-North-South?\n\n\n2. I have added many national parks (Corbett and others). National parks are generally expensive for foreigners in terms of money as well as time. At the first glance most of these look the same to me. What do recommend to drop among those? Booking a safari in one or two of national parks to see Tigers and any beautiful vistas would do for me.\n\n\n3. Jammu Kashmir. How safe is it to go there? Regular transport is available? How are Jammu, Kashmir and Leh different from Manali, Solang valley, Spiti valley?\n\n\n4. Please recommend me any lesser-known places.",

        "content": "Why has the state of Gujarat been allowed to hold out on the translocation of Asiatic Lions?. I was recently listening to a wildlife podcast that hosted Dr.Ravi Chellam; a preeminent personality in Lion conservation when I learnt that the project of translocation of the Lion is almost three decades old. The Wildlife Institute of India (autonomous conservation institute under the umbrella of the GOI) had recommended back then that a small subset of Gir Lion population should be relocated to a former Lion habitat as far away from Gir as possible to mitigate the risks of an epidemic. I think most of us are aware of the more recent events in this regard, but I\u2019ll recap just for completeness:\n\n1990 - First recommendation from WII for translocation\n\n\n1993 - PHVA report finds Kuno to be the most suitable site\n\n\n2003 - Human villages (comprising roughly 1545 families) in Kuno relocated to prevent man-lion conflicts\n\n\n2004 - Gujarat government refuses to release the Lions to Madhya Pradesh\n\n\n2007 - Kuno habitat certified as ready to receive Lions\n\n\n2013 - The Supreme Court rules against Gujarat, and orders that the translocation be completed within 6 months\n\n\n2015 - The Union government revises the requirements of the habitat in Kuno. Madhya Pradesh government refuses to undertake further change as that would mean more relocation of human populations. Finally, the Union government also adjourns the translocation to Kuno under safety considerations.\n\n\n2020 - PM announced a few new potential sites for translocation under Project Lion.\n\n\nNow, I would love to make my point keeping politics aside, and I will try to keep party politics aside for sure, but at the end of the day, there is some level of politics involved here because at present the Asiatic Lions in Gir have given Gujarat a unique status in all of India, if not in the whole world. It is understandable that they\u2019re at reluctant to give up that status. However, this isn\u2019t the best for conservation of the species, and also while they will lose their solo status, it doesn\u2019t mean that they will lose all wildlife tourism value altogether. I mean there are several habitats of the tiger, sloth bear, leopard, elephant and rhinoceroses in India, and yet some locations do get more visitors because of various reasons:\n1) Abundant population\n2) Terrain amenable for safari/sightings\n3) Facilities provided by the forest department and/or the state government.\n\nAs to the recent announcement by the PM, it may not result in anything unless the Gujarat state government comes to the table.\n\nSo, the question remains - why is the rest of the country, or more precisely the Union government allowing the state of Gujarat to effectively hold the lion population hostage?",

I want to go to Gujarat but it seems it \"The protected area of Gir National Park is closed from\u00a0**16th June to 15th October**\u00a0every year. It is the period when the southwest monsoon arrives\". Is it completely closed? or are there any places we can still visit but only jungle safari is not allowed?\n\nAlso I read somewhere that Rann of kutch is best visited in November since they have some festival and the water from monsoon rain would have evaporated to form roads and stuff. Initially, I considered skipping Rann of Kutch entirely but many say it is a cool place\n\nDoes Punjab have similar closed-off corridors in September?",

I was flying back to Bangalore a few days ago and helped a guy at the airport who was struggling with baggage weight and what he could carry. Coincidentally, he ended up being my seatmate on the flight, and even lived near me in HSR. We chatted and decided to take the airport bus together after landing.\n\nI had placed my black Safari bag under the seat in the center luggage section \u2014 and dozed off while listening to music. One song later, I opened my eyes and casually glanced over\u2026\n\nMy bag was gone.\n\nInstead, there was a completely different bag \u2014 bigger, shinier, with a green stripe. Definitely not mine.\n\nI checked around the bus, asked others, and even looked at the remaining bags. Nothing. I called Akasa Air, and their response was:\n\n\u201cPlease send us an email and wait 24\u201348 hours. Or file a complaint at the airport \u2014 the process takes 2\u20134 days.\u201d\n\nThat didn\u2019t sit well with me, especially with work starting Monday and all my stuff in that bag.\n\nSo I looked at the tag on the wrong bag \u2014 it had the person\u2019s name and PNR number. I used the PNR to check their booking on the airline site, downloaded the e-ticket, and found the phone number.\n\nI called him.\n\nHe realized immediately he\u2019d taken my bag by mistake and apologized. He had gone to Nagawara but had a house in Koramangala, which helped. We agreed he\u2019d come by the next day to return it, and he did \u2014 around 3:45 PM.\n\nHis friend saw both bags and even said, \u201cHow did you mess this up?\u201d\nAnd just then, I got an email from Akasa saying the process could take 3\u20135 days to even start.\n\nSo yeah \u2014 if I had waited, I probably wouldn\u2019t have had my bag in time.\nBecause I acted quickly, I had it back within 13 hours, and I knew who had it within 20 minutes of realizing it was missing.\n\nNo hero moment here \u2014 just a reminder that sometimes being calm and doing the obvious thing is more effective than waiting on a system.\n\nHas anyone else gone through something like this?",

        "content": "dads search history . As a kid I often snooped around papas phone just to check if he was loyal to mom. I dont know why I did that I just did. I didnt know that there would come a day when I would actually find something.\n\nI wasnt snooping I was j searching something on his safari browser and something happened and his old tabs opened up.\n\nAerocity Escorts was one of them. I started questioning my dad a bit bout when his flight was where did he spend the afternoon. I also thought that who would want sex in the afternoon during a layover if he is actually a cheater. But then I just started mentioning the flight thing to my mum (not the browser thing) and she said how she felt as if he had come a day earlier and stayed in delhi.\n\nI recalled I had called my dad that day and while we were on call I tried to switch it to vid and he would j not pick up eventhough he said he was sleeping when he did pickup he was in his banyan and sleeping and I didnt doubt much cause thats how he sleeps if its too hot but when he was about to cut the call I saw a phone screen in the call I dismissed it thinking it was the reflection of lighting on the marble floor. But as soon as my mum said that I knew I had to tell her. \n\nAnd so I did.\n\nHer response to that was I can never believe that. She said I could've said anything else and she would've believed me but this she doesnt. She said my thinking was dirty and pessimistic. And I left it at that.\n\nI do not know how I feel about this and honestly I wish I wouldn't have told my mother cause what can she do expect tell herself to not believe it. I want her to not bring it up w dad I told her I am with her in this that I too feel dad would not be like such and that I felt responsible to tell her after I saw her reaction eventhough I dont believe it.\n\nIt's just as someone who has been sexually harassed by a family relative before my faith in men is non existent and dad was that safe space for me, the only man I trusted. Not anymore.\n\nI feel extremely narcissistic to think about this rn but all I can see is that how broken it would be to not be loved and adored by someone and I do not want that for myself. So I am spiralling for no fucking reason that in the times I live I am bound to not be loved.",

        "content": "my first tiger siting. This is my story of watching my first ever TIGER in wildlife safari. It's one of those days in january,cloudy atmosphere,cold breeze and a news from people who came before us, \"TIGER nahi hai iss area me\" with disheartened heart i asked my family to atleast be happy that as a family we came for safari and we should be happy even if we see deers and gours. Having this thought in mind we enter Tadoba's gate. after spending 5 mins in the jungle,i saw shouts of frightened group of men running towards us,they stopped us and told us that there is a huge tiger that attacked us from behind. \n\nPanicked us, and my mum got really scared. The guide asked who did he attack,and one from the group said he took one of our cow. and showed us the direction where the tiger attacked his cow. We rushed to the site,while heading towards the site my hand started sweating,my mouth went dry and I couldnt feel my legs. Upon reaching the site we saw something that made the gypsy the quitest,even the gypsy was scared of the site. We saw a huge tiger(chota matka) eating a cow, around 100 meters from us, his face was covered in blood and his canines were flashing white. as we reached there,Tiger took a pause and looked at us with lazy eyes and calculating the threat we were to him. No one in our gypsy was making any movement,everyone was just scared and threatened at the same time. After watching him eat  for 5 mins,he grabbed the cow from upper neck area and started to pull his prey into the forest. imagine a 3-400kg cow being dragged by a tiger,the view is still fresh in my mind. Even after the tiger went into the forest and after 10 mins passed by,no one had the guts to speak in the fear that tiger might hear our voice and come back to charge us(naive us). From getting a news of no tiger siting,than to watch the tiger in one of his furious gesture,i felt lucky for the first time in my life.Gist of this post is,if you feel stuck in life or you are down and out, go and watch a tiger,you will feel alive and refreshed.",

In the depths of a Sunday morning, the weary travelers returned from the mystical lands of Tirupati, their energy reserves as depleted as a water hole in the dry savannas. Behold, three noble roommates, not succumbing to the temptation of extended slumber, but rising from their beds at the uncivilized hour of 10.\n\nAs the sun cast its gentle rays upon their humble abode, a culinary symphony unfolded. I, the South Indian savant, conjured breakfast puddus with the finesse of a seasoned magician, while my esteemed comrade, a maestro of North Indian delicacies, embarked on a culinary journey with the sacred Rajma. Meanwhile, the third musketeer, undeterred by fatigue, engaged in the ancient art of broom-wielding and mop mastery, transforming the dwelling into a sanctuary of cleanliness.\n\nIn the heart of this domestic safari, exhaustion lingered in the air like the distant call of a tired wildebeest. Yet, not a murmur of complaint escaped their lips. Three valiant lads from Mumbai, each wielding their expertise like seasoned hunters, seamlessly navigating the wild terrain of household chores.\n\nAnd lo, as the breakfast feasting concluded, I, the South Indian maestro, assumed the sacred duty of dishwashing, while the lunch saga unfolded in the hands of the North Indian virtuoso. A triumphant spectacle, a testament to camaraderie and shared responsibilities, as three tired souls conquered the domestic wilderness, emerging victorious in the tale of the Sunday household escapade.",

        "content": "Ayyappan's Legacy: A Tale of Joy and Resilience in a Kerala Village. In the verdant heart of Kerala, nestled among whispering coconut palms, there lived a joyful soul named Ayyappan, a humble coconut seller whose very presence seemed to weave happiness into the fabric of his village. His quaint hut, a larger abode that doubled as a grocery store by the time he turned 38, was more than just a dwelling. It was a bustling hub where villagers not only came to buy their daily essentials but also to exchange stories, laughter, and the warmth of community life.\n\nAyyappan's home was a canvas of colors and traditions, with two beautifully crafted steps leading up to a platform, each adorned with intricate chalk rangoli patterns that sparked the curiosity of every passerby, young and old. It was here, in this small yet welcoming hut, that Ayyappan lived with his short, traditional wife, their spirited daughter, and a mischievous nephew, filling his days with joy and simple pleasures.\n\nEach morning, as the village awoke to the calls of distant roosters, Ayyappan and his family gathered around a banana leaf, their fingers deftly enjoying the steaming dosas, their taste enhanced by the tart, refreshing sip of kokam drink. This was a life of modest means yet rich with contentment.\n\nBeyond his duties as a grocer, Ayyappan also served as the village's unofficial guide. His reputation once brought a senior government officer from Tamil Nadu to his doorstep, clad in a pristine white safari suit, arriving in a gleaming ambassador car\u2014an unusual sight in this quiet part of the world. Together, they ventured through the village and down to a park that cascaded towards a breathtaking sea view. Sitting on a stone bench, sipping coconut water, they talked beneath the watchful gaze of stone-carved statues of Lord Buddha and Shivaji, set against the backdrop of the sea.\n\nThe village fairground was a place of celebration, where Ayyappan\u2019s nephew\u2019s birthday transformed into a festival of joy. The air was alive with the sound of native tunes, the warmth of a bonfire, and the laughter of children playing around a Ferris wheel with pink sofas and numerous swings, sparking a childlike wonder in all who watched.\n\nTragedy, however, wove its threads through the tapestry of Ayyappan\u2019s life. In his forties, as he aimed to ensure a prosperous future for his daughter, he faced the profound sorrow of losing his wife. Yet, in the face of loss, his spirit remained unbroken. He adopted a young boy, his oily hair and old wooden slate a symbol of new beginnings, as he supported his education at a quaint primary school led by an old teacher with thick spectacles.\n\nAs he approached his late forties, Ayyappan\u2019s dreams grew; he yearned for higher education and to develop exceptional talents, reflecting a late-blooming but fierce desire to achieve more. But life had other plans, and at the tender age of 49, he succumbed to tuberculosis, leaving behind a village dimmed by his departure.\n\nYet, Ayyappan\u2019s legacy endured. His life, marked by the simple joys of community, resilience in the face of hardship, and the unending pursuit of happiness, continued to inspire and ignite curiosity in the hearts of those he left behind. In Kerala, his story remained a tender reminder of a life beautifully lived, his spirit a beacon of hope and joy that continued to guide his village.",

        "content": "Weird little incident at an event.. I(22M) visited one education fair at a big hotel where delegates and officials from the USA came to interact with students. I went with my parents and we were seated in a seminar hall and my mom was thirsty. I saw a lot of bottles on a table and I saw a guy wearing a safari suit standing by the table. I casually asked the guy if I could take 2 bottles(I could also see a few foreign delegates sitting there so I also had a doubt if the water and other condiments were only for the staff and delegates)\n\nThe guy(Indian, Mid-Late 20s) replied in an extremely rude tone and asked me why I was asking questions. My head spun for a second as I couldn't understand why someone would be so rude for such a casual thing. I was like, \"Excuse me sir, I just wanted to ask if prospective students and visitors are allowed to take the water bottle\". He was really rude this time and told me that I shouldn't be asking any questions or talk to him. I saw his badge, he was a police man so I figured out he was part of the delegates' security assigned by the state government. I was still shook as why would someone talk to a random person like that so I turned around and started to walk towards my seat. As soon as I turned, a delegate(American, Black woman, early to mid 40s) asked me to take the water and the guy in the safari suit was like \"Who do you think I am? How can you ask questions to me? I'm not the hotel management staff.\" I apologised to him but in my head I was like even he's not the hotel management staff it's not a big deal to answer a simple question or just saying don't know, is not a big deal even if you're the prime minister of India. There are some basic manners and courtesy as a civil, human society.\n\nI came back to my seat and I was thinking how such a small thing can hurt a person's ego. I felt really worthless when the guy talked to me in that way. At the same time I think there are some protocols these people have to follow like not interact with random people when they are at work. Idk maybe I should've been smarter about it.\n\nIdk, what do you guys make of this little incident?",

Hey everyone,\n\nI recently switched from Android to iOS, and while I like Safari for how natural and fast it feels, I\u2019ve run into a problem. Unlike on Android, Safari automatically plays videos at the highest quality, which makes it really difficult to watch shows without burning through my data. A lot of the sites I used before either don\u2019t work properly on iOS, or if they do, they end up eating way more data than they should.\n\nSo, I\u2019m looking for a site that:\n\t1.\tHas a wide library of TV shows (including older and lesser-known ones).\n\t2.\tLets me manually set the quality (I mostly watch in 240p/360p to save data, so this is the most important part).\n\t3.\tPreferably has fewer pop-ups and ads (not a huge deal, but the less annoying, the better).\n\nIf anyone knows a site that works well on iOS/Safari, I\u2019d really appreciate it. Thanks!",

        "content": "Weekend Getaway from Mumbai & Delhi \u2013 My Solo Travel Experience at Jawai (Leopard Safari + Peaceful Stay). Hey fellow travellers! \ud83d\udc4b\n\nI recently did a solo weekend trip to Jawai, a lesser-known gem in Rajasthan known for its leopard safaris, serene landscapes, and peaceful village vibes. Posting this for anyone who wants a wild yet soul-soothing escape\u2014especially if you\u2019re looking for something doable from Mumbai or Delhi over a weekend. \ud83d\ude4c\n\n\ud83d\udc06 Why Jawai?\nUnlike the usual jungle safaris, Jawai is raw and rocky\u2014leopards roam freely across granite hills and live in harmony with the local Rabari community. I spotted two leopards on a sunset safari, and it felt completely surreal.\n\nOther highlights:\n\nMigratory birds and crocodiles at Jawai Dam\n\nBeautiful sunrises over boulders\n\nNo crazy tourist rush\u2014just calm and wild nature\n\n\ud83d\ude89 Getting There \u2013 Very Solo-Friendly\nOvernight trains from Mumbai and Delhi make it super doable:\n\nFrom Mumbai: Board Ranakpur Express or Suryanagri Express (Friday night), get off at Jawai Bandh or Falna, reach next morning\n\nFrom Delhi: Mandore Express, Ashram Express etc. to Jawai Bandh or Mori Bera\n\nFrom the station, I arranged a cab through the stay\u2014super convenient. Jawai is also accessible by road (~3 hours from Udaipur or Jodhpur).\n\n\ud83c\udfe1 Where I Stayed: Jawai Retreat\nHands down, this made the trip memorable.\n\nClean, peaceful rooms (they have budget and luxury options)\n\nGreat food, bonfire vibes, and helpful staff\n\nThey arranged my safaris, village walk, and even chai under a banyan tree \ud83e\udef6\n\nMet another solo traveler at dinner, so you\u2019re not totally on your own\n\nHighly recommend if you're looking for something local, cozy, and not overly commercial.\n\nInstagram : jawairetreat\n\n\ud83e\udded My 2-Day Solo Itinerary\nTime\tActivity\nFri Night\tOvernight train from Mumbai/Delhi\nSat Morning\tPick-up & check-in at Jawai Retreat\nSat Evening\tLeopard Safari & sunset on the hills\nSat Night\tBonfire, Rajasthani dinner\nSun Morning\tOptional safari or village walk\nSun Noon\tCheck-out and return\n\n\ud83c\udf92 Travel Tips\nPack layers (cold mornings)\n\nTake binoculars for birding\n\nDownload offline maps (network is patchy)\n\nTrust the locals\u2014they know the land better than any app\n\nFinal Thoughts\nIf you're someone who wants to travel solo but doesn\u2019t want overwhelming crowds or crazy logistics\u2014Jawai hits the sweet spot. It\u2019s wild but safe, quiet but not boring, and gives you that real Rajasthan vibe without the tourist noise.\n\nLet me know if you want contacts, booking info, or help planning a similar trip! \ud83d\ude0a",

I seriously don\u2019t get the insane hype around Dubai among Indians lately. Every second person\u2019s planning a trip there, some even going again, and for what?? Skyscrapers, malls, desert safari? You get skyscrapers in Mumbai too. Malls? Bro, you\u2019re flying 3 hours for a glorified DLF with blasting ac?\n\nThe city was built like yesterday, there\u2019s literally zero real culture or history to experience. Just man-made stuff in the middle of a desert. And let\u2019s not even get into how it was built. Yeah, exploited migrant labour (a huge chunk from India), people forced to work in 50\u00b0C heat, passports taken, inhuman hours and wages. This is not hidden info, it\u2019s reported by BBC, Amnesty, Al Jazeera, everywhere. Yet no one talks about it. It\u2019s like all that gets ignored because \u201cBurj Khalifa\u201d.\n\nAlso, it\u2019s cheap ik but you can spend the same or less in Thailand, Vietnam, Sri Lanka and those places have actual beauty, culture, nature, food, and vibes. \n\nSo fr... what is the actual appeal? Why are people going again and again? Is it the luxury flex? Shopping? FOMO? And most importantly why's no one talking about it, the dark making of this city?!",

Affordable and still can reach out! Ideally someone who loves travel stuff, and wouldn\u2019t mind trading city noise for the sound of elephants trumpeting at sunrise.\n\nWould love any suggestions, thanks in advance!",

I tried for the buffer zones too but the website is just shit.\n1) Does anyone have any local contact to get a booking there? \n2) Is it worth driving 10 hr for just the resort?

        "content": "Unorganised Australian who would love your help with my trip to India next month! Flying into Mumbai, headed to Dharamshala.. Firstly I apologise in advance for any ignorance or queries I could google. I find the internet can be a bit broad when it comes to travel, would much rather attain advice straight from locals! \n\nI'm visiting India for the first time next month with my dad and brother, we absolutely cannot wait. Bit of backround, my brother and I are young adults and my dad is in his early 50s but we're all active and keen for anything. \n\nPlan so far is fly into Mumbai and have a look around there for a couple days. \nWe're then undecided on what to do between there and the 26th, as we're then heading to Dharamshala to watch India v Australia which should be amazing. \n\nWe really wanna get the most out of the period between Mumbai Dharamshala (13 days, 16th-28th of Feb).\n\nWe wanna go South to Kerala. Apparently Kochi has amazing houseboat tours. If theres anywhere else down south we must visit do let us know ! \n\nI've pitched the Idea of heading to Udaipur/Rajasthan, and visiting a national park, potentially an animal friendly safari tour. \n\nWe have 8 nights booked in Dharamshala, giving us 2 days to look around before the cricket on the 1st-5th of March. \n\nWe booked this long as we'll be busy with the cricket for most of our stay there, and don't wanna miss out on exploring the foothils of the Himalayas. However that is quite a long time, so if you think we can get more out of visiting the north and ending up in Dharamshala just before the cricket, then thats definitely a possibility, as my brother isnt such a fan of Cricket and 8 days in Dharamshala is probably a bit much for him.\n\nA couple other queries I had were: \n\n* I'll receive my passport about 13-14 days before our trip on the 15th of Feb (I know, stupid). Visas to India supposedly take 1-14 days. I really dont wanna risk this, apparently It'd only take 1-2 days on Ivisa.com, happy to pay the $30 if theres any truth to that! \n\n*  As far as converting money goes, Is it best we bring AUD cash over, convert it, then load it onto a card? \n*  Absolutely anything you guys thinks could assist us on our trip would be amazing! Things to bring, what to expect etc etc.\n\nThank you so much in advance. I can't wait for our trip. My great great grandad was born in Jaipur and I'm really proud of that heritage.\n\nUpdate : https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/112t71x",

First of all I'd just like to say that I grew up in Kenya (18 years) and I've been to India twice now. Love it. Growing up in Kenya I used to go on safari frequently. Since going to India I haven't been on a safari. We would love to try to see a wild tiger. My biggest question would be what all is involved? Are there any places that are better than others? Is hiking an option? I will say that I am bringing my wife, who has been to India once, and she will be going to Kenya with me this year. Thanks for taking the time to read this and I appreciate any info. \nEdit: Thanks to everyone for responding! This is very helpful information. I really just can't wait to go back.",

        "content": "Why is the Indian suitcase industry so broken?. Yes this is a rant. I'm mad. \nSo my family owns a few VIP and Safari suitcases and bags, some of which we got as gifts and others we bought. Almost every one of them has given us some sort of trouble within warranty. Got a 4-wheeler VIP suitcase when they were recently launched and two of the wheels broke within two uses. Recently got a bag and one of the wheels went kaput within 6 months. \n\nThe worst part? Their websites are disgusting. Nowhere you can find anything about getting your bags fixed or repaired, within warranty or otherwise. And this is where I started getting frustrated. I wrote an e-mail to Safari in the 'contact us' page requesting a location where I can take it in for repair and there's no reply yet. VIP does it even worse, their 'contact us' page is a feedback page. \n\nOut of curiosity, I went over to American Tourister's (owned by Samsonite)  'warranty and service' page and it handed me a PDF with their locations, their contacts and addresses. \n\n\nNow I own nothing that's made by American Tourister or Samsonite so I'm not promoting either of these brands but why don't indian brands give better support for their products? It's like they just want to sell and bail. There's no responsibility. It's almost like once you've bought something from them, you're on your own. I remember that my parents struggled to get their VIP suitcases fixed even within warranty in the past and had to run around store to store; each of which directed them to go to another store for warranty claims, that too in Delhi (this was in the early 2000s so no internet for us). \n\nWhat's a customer supposed to do with these things once they break? Even in warranty they're a pain to get fixed.\n\nUpdate: called the number given for their Pune centre and both numbers are registered as service numbers but also invalid. Wow.\n\nUpdate 2: went to a VIP showroom and that problem will be sorted soon. Safari is still dodgy. Never buying from either of them again tho.",

The furore that was generated by the racial harassment of the Tanzanian student in Bangalore, many of my fellow Kannadigas were quick to say that Karnataka isn't like that.\n\n\"African Safari\" screams today's headline in a popular Kannada daily edition of Today. The newspaper goes to length to cast aspersions & innuendos about the African community here in Bangalore. \n\nWhile it is easy to criticize English newspapers & media for all their omissions & commissions, at least they have been sensible, pragmatic & mature. But the vernacular press gets away with open racism, casteism & regionalism. This is the newsmedia the auto drivers, labourers etc get to read & it generally clouds their mindset and makes discrimination acceptable. And these are the same people who beat, strip & harass people who are 'different'.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/pptBFht\n\nEdit: The headline says 'African Savaari' not 'African Safari'. But the point still stands. The paper calls the Tanzanian ambassador's entourage as an African Savaari (African Ride)",

        "content": "The Scam that is JioFiber. **Disclaimer:**\n\nThis post is coming after a lot of frustration being built up. I don't expect everyone to find this appropriate to bring out here or express my anger. But I needed to vent it out and let people know of the inconvenience caused to me by Reliance Jio. All the names of people mentioned have been changed from the real name.\n\n**Prologue:**\n\nWe have had JioFiber from sometime now. I have renewed it for 6 months in March of this year. Unfortunately it has not worked as promised ever since. I have had registered approximately 2 complaints with customer care every week since subscription, that makes a total of at least 8 complaint since March 2021 when my plan has begun. Every-time a technician/engineer has come they fiddle for a few minutes and then go away until the problem arises again. \n\nHowever, this time it got too serious to take it lightly\u2026 or to listen to their excuses.\n\nThe problem began on 23rd April 2021 when I was uploading a 50gb to my OneDrive on my wifi (JioFiber). I have a 300 mbps plan from them Here are what they have promised to me from what I remember: \n\n1: A download speed of 300 mbps \n\n2: An upload speed of 300 mbps, \n\n3: A free phone connection, that is a landline number. \n\n4: A Jio SetTop box with about 15 OTT services as promised by them. (Don't remember all of them by heart)\n\nBefore we go ahead, for anybody that doesn't know. In any given internet connection, for example mine. The actual download speed is calculated by dividing 300 mbps by 8. So, 37.5mbps is how many data packets should be transmitted. \n\nIf you use Google Chrome, this is the rate of transfer the Download Manager should be showing. However, since wifi has some loss so anybody should be prepared to see a number not exactly the same but slightly lower. **Slightly** being the operative word.\n\n**Part One:**\n\nComing back to uploading the file I noticed the file itself was uploading only at a speed of 10-20 mbps. Which if I reverse, and multiply by a factor of 8 goes to 160 Mbps, half the plan promised to me.\n\nI registered a complaint for the same on 23rd April, 2021. Next day, 24th April, 2021 an engineer Mr. Ram visits my premises. After spending an hour looking at what I explained to him (Screenshots attached). He was unable to find a solution and called his superior Mr. Shyam. Who also was unable to fix this issue and asked me to wait for the Networking team to get back to me. This was as mentioned on Saturday, 24th April, 2021. By the end of 26th April there was no response so I followed up with Mr. Shyam.\n\nMore on that in a bit\u2026\n\nI have a 300 mpbs plan as mentioned above and if I visit any \u2018Speed test\u2019 website, like Ookla, or [fast.com](http://fast.com/) or the Jio recommended NetVelocity. The same is reflected perfectly. That means they all show that my devices are getting a speed of 280 mbps, which according to the earlier mentioned **slightly** lower speed is accurate. \n\nUnfortunately, it feels like manipulating as the **real world** test does not even come close to any of the numbers provided. I am getting download speed in Kbps and maximum of 10-12mbps when using Safari or Chrome browser, to download large files from wither OneDrive or Google Drive. Where the same at one point was reflecting 30-31 mbps.\n\nI am attaching the screenshot from my browser for anybody reading this to look at. One is of a speed test website which shows great internet speeds. Unfortunately when I opened Chrome browser to use Google Drive and One Drive individually right after that test. Either of them when downloading a file are unable to get the download speed from speed test.\n\nI am aware that if speed test shows 284.88 Mbps, I should be getting a reflecting speed of 284.88/8 = 35.61Mbps in my browser. However, the numbers are no where close to that. It\u2019s sad to the point where even WhatsApp text messages take 2-3 seconds for a single tick mark (delivered status) to show.  \n \n\n**Part two:**\n\nAfter following up on 27th and 28th April, 2021 with the supervisor Mr. Shyam mentioned above. \n\nAnother engineer Mr. Rohan had visited my premises on 28/04/21 Wednesday. I demonstrated the issue once again to him and he could not provide a solution. He then connected me with his superior, Mr. Tanmay. He said he understood my issue and explained to me that to further escalate the issue Mr. Rohan would need to bring the company laptop to my premises and test the same issue. \n\nCurrently we had tested it on my phone, my fathers phone, my laptop with 2 web browsers and 2 separate websites. But more testing is always better so I agreed. \n\nThe engineer, Mr. Rohan did indeed visit my premises next day 29/04/21 Thursday, along with a colleague. \n\nHe then proceeded to do speed test on his laptop and phone over wifi on the websites mentioned above, OOkla, [Fast.com](http://fast.com/), and net velocity. To my surprise the speeds did not match on even one of the websites/devices. On the laptop OOkla showed a speed of 150 mbps. [Fast.com](http://fast.com/) showed 400 mbps. And OOKla on his phone showed 220 mbps.\n\nHet then tried downloading some files on his laptop and phone from different websites one of which was Disney+ Hotstar on his phone. Now the file from Hotstar app was downloading on his phone, and it did not show the download speed, but the percentage. So we tried to time it. Taking 220 mbps as an accurate speed.\n\n220 mbps / 8 = 27.5 mbps. The file was 2.98 gb. So, by calculation 2980 mb / 27.5 mbps = 108.36363636 seconds. That means 1.8 minutes the full file should be downloaded. I rounded it off to 2 minutes. So hoping 2 minutes the full 100% of the file should have been downloaded. \n\nNow for the interesting part, in the entire 2 minutes over wifi where all my other device had been disconnected, because even though they\u2019re are not being used background data will take up speed. In the entire 2 minutes only 10% got completed.\n\nThe same was tried to replicate over LAN on his laptop. This time [Fast.com](http://fast.com/) showed a speed of 600 mbps. And this time we could see the download speed in the Download manager of the browser. 10 mbps. Which translates to 80 mbps.\n\nRunning multiple tests on LAN and Wifi on 2 of his devices there was **no resolution**. Even having spoken to his superior Mr. Tanmay and explained the same to him did not bring me any resolution. Mind you Mr. Tanmay was being sent videos and photos of everything from Mr. Rohans phone. So he was being updated every minute of the issue.\n\nAll in all there was testing done on, 2 cloud storage drives each on 2 different browsers on my laptop. My phone. My fathers phone. 2 engineers phones. And the company laptop as recommended by Mr. Rohan.\n\n  \n**Jio Conclusion**\n\nEven after all this extensive testing and pleading Jio multiple times I was told finally told 2 things.\n\n1: We are the internet provider, its not our responsibility to take care of the download speeds you receive at your end.\n\n2: There must be some issue with the websites I am visiting and they must be blocking the internet.\n\nAfter this I was tired. Since I could not keep asking Jio engineers to keep coming over because of COVID restrictions, and also having my parents and grandfather in the house. I just asked the person to leave.\n\n  \n**My Conclusion**\n\nI don\u2019t understand how they cannot take accountability and responsibility for the low internet speed proved in front of their eyes. \n\nIf it was the websites problems then why ask me to wait for tests to be done on the company laptop. And how can all the websites across all the devices ( mine and the engineer\u2019s) have the same issue, but nothing is faulty on the Jio side.\n\nIf anybody is considering to shift to Jio or thinking to stay long term, please consider this post as a real review of the service. Just wanted to put this out with everyone so that if there are similar people facing same issues they can also put it here.  \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Google Drive](https://preview.redd.it/bcevi3m5maw61.png?width=1520&format=png&auto=webp&s=eb803a3a0c8df809ca84f77bfec84babe615fe7c)\n\n[One Drive](https://preview.redd.it/1w7326m5maw61.png?width=1520&format=png&auto=webp&s=4571cf7e1667ff1796af64bb362f891b77c99459)\n\n[Speed test OOkla](https://preview.redd.it/75ctb7m5maw61.png?width=1520&format=png&auto=webp&s=8932c764627958dc9f295ce8939bb66b84c2d902)",

        "content": "MRW I see the \"India has beautiful roads too!\" circlejerk (And Rant too). New reddit user and long time lurker here!\n\nI saw all these posts and noticed that in most of them, the views were beautiful but the roads were shit. They should be titled, \"India has beautiful views too!\" But that shows the sheer potential of our nation as a tourist and sightseeing location. Just like how they have Safari Tours to Africa, we can have to too with the Ghats and other places!\n\nVery few countries have the beauty where you can go skiing in the Himalayas one moment, smoke weed in the forests another, bask in the desert after that, trek through the jungle, and finally chill at the beach with a refreshing beer! And during the whole time, you can see history in your eyes as you visit monuments!\n\nAnd that could be only possible if we had decent infra. I know that it takes around 4 hours to get from Pune to Mumbai. A distance of only 150 km. And that is considered \"State of the Art!\" In other countries including China and even some African nations, I see that same distance covered in an hour or so! It's pathetic how we consider this state of the art!\n\nImagine if we had roads and a traffic structure that allowed foreigners to do the trip that I described above very quickly!\n\nAnd as a Civil Engineer specialized in roads and working in Japan, I cringe every time I see roads back in the motherland. They look okay from the outside but misses some key features to make them worthwhile. I notice the poor grading done which creates some disgusting and uneven ridges in them. And cost isn't a problem here. It is the fucked up, \"Chalta hain\" attitude. It costs the same to grade a road properly. I see footpaths that require you to go full hanuman to get over them! A very bad design flaw which makes it difficult for people with disabilities! In addition, I also see some extremely high up dividers in city roads. That is also a big flaw in the design as emergency vehicles which are sometimes designed to go over shallow medians cannot anymore. I don't know why the median is there in the first place. Perhaps it has to do with chutiya drivers in India who would be driving in the wrong direction if it wasn't there. But even Japan has physical dividers.\n\nAnd I looked at the road code put by the congi gobernment, and it was an exact copy of the British system. They didn't even put effort into changing the terminology! You see, the problem here is that we Civil Engineers of India look like idiots who cannot do anything right! We lose all pride. And on top of that, does it hurt to have an indigenous system that we can pride in? Imagine if ISRO was just a copy of Russian Design!\n\nAnd even we can contribute to road design. We have many bright minds in our country who are lost effort. When I was in Uni, all we did was memorize the British road code and had to regurgitate them out on our exams and do some calculations! What if we get the Uni students to design the code with professors as research? Not only would it look good on resumes, but we would end up with a fantastic road code of our own and it will get the innovative spirit when it comes to building infra!\n\nAnd we have ISRO which we take great pride in. I always wanted to suggest getting ISRO and the Cabinet Committee On Infrastructure to create a state of the art software that maps the country as well as the roads with GPS accuracy! And this can be a sort of AutoCAD software that Civil Engineering students can practice road design virtually and even design the new road code and test it on that software! And that same mapping and finalized design can be used to build the roads with a proper code and everything!\n\nAnd the problem about infra is that all these key flaws will be a pain in the ass 50 years down the line. Lets say India is one of the top superpowers then and we realize this later. It will cost a trillion dollars in correcting this shit!\n\nDoes anybody know how I can suggest this idea to the government?",

It was a joyful ride from Bangalore to Chikmagalur .We have reached our destination by night and planned for safari in the morning and visit some water falls later .But God has some other plans for us . As our plan we started early in the morning and started to Bhadra wild life sanctuary .To our disappointment we could not see a single tiger in the whole safari . \n        We started our return journey from there .It was a ghat road  and we took a few snaps on the way .The climate was cool and started drizzling. We are all enjoying the drive but all of a sudden the car went out of control and moved towards the valley and went down till some distance  . I had to say we are very lucky as there was a strong tree to stop the further movement of the car . If not for that , I wouldn't be here writing this post . As soon as one of my friend got out , he called for help and people started to gather around and asking questions if are safe and all .I couldn't come out as the door was struck .Later some one helped me  and I came out side .Two of us remained at the site and we asked the rest of our friends to leave for the hotel. \n    We are stuck there in the rain with our car which cannot be taken out with out a crane looking for help. and there comes a stranger how stared helping us and sent a police to us. The police and very polite and first asked f we are safe and called for a crane and went on his way . It was still raining heavily and  we should wait there for one hour for crane to come . Another stranger passed by on bike smiling at us .We thought he is having fun looking at us in this situation ,but to our surprise he came with an umbrella .\n   we some how returned with the car to the hotel and needed some repair to the car (only the front was damaged and it is full condition).  The search for mechanic was very difficult as it was a Sunday afternoon and all the garages were closed .In this search we have encountered  some four people who are very patient to direct where we can find a mechanic. And when we finally found one he was very helpful and kind that he came all the way fixed our car tested it and assured we can go back driving it .  \n   There are some more people who helped us  all the way back to Bangalore. After this incident I have learned that we should never loose faith in Humanity .",

        "content": "Help me plan my travel itinerary.... to Rajasthan and more!. Hi good people of r/ india ... so I wish to do some solo travelling before I leave for Canada for my studies. I plan to do this for about 25 days after Diwali and I hope that staying in hostels \u2026 and travelling and other things... it'll come under 40k \u2026\n\nPlaces that I wish to visit:\n\nI'll take a train(the 3AC) from Delhi to ...\n\nRajasthan: It has so much variety and colours and is different from the North where I'm from and also from Canada haha\u2026 so I'd like to experience it and please tell me how much time should I spend in each place.\n\nJodhpur, Jaisalmer, Udaipur(Chittorgarh, Kumbhalgarh, Ranakpur), Pushkar ( it has that camel festival from 4th November)\u2026 I don't think there's much in Jaipur!.... maybe a day in Ranthambore National Park too since I have never been in a safari before.\n\nAfter this I'm confused about where to go...I think I could either go from Udaipur to Mumbai( 16 hrs).... then Goa( 13 hrs)... then Hampi( 8 hrs)\u2026 (I feel like this is a really interesting place unlike any other, so this deserves a visit) \u2026staying few days in each place but then I'm unsure which way to come back and also if so many places are even possible... should I return the same way and the take a final flight from Mumbai(5k) if I go this way?\n\nOr I could go east to Khajuraho temple from Udaipur( 22 hr train journey)\u2026 then to Varanasi( 13 hrs)\u2026 But I think this is a bit astray from the typical route and I'm not sure if I should go to Varanasi but it also attracts me because it would be the most Indian place .\n\nNow places I have already visited which I'm leaving are Taj Mahal and Golden Temple and Agra... and the cold places of north... Also, I have a tour planned to Andaman Islands next month with my family... so maybe I could spend less time in Goa if you guys advise me go through that route.\n\nP.S. I'll be 19 by the end of this trip and this is going to be my first trip ever which I'll document on my camera too. Besides, I( a dude) figured that if solo women from the west could manage to stay safe in India... I can pull this through too ! Any advice you all give would be appreciated. Thanks!",

The cheapest RWD car available right now is the BMW 3 series, the cheapest one is 26 lakh rupees.\n\n\nWHY? :(",

Would be grateful if someone could give me some clarity.\n\n- Is November a good time to visit? \n- What is an ideal no. of days? \n- Which desert safari would you recommend?\n- Any **must** visit places?\n\nI've heard a bunch about camping in the desert under the stars and am very excited about it. Any info about this would be awesome as well :)\n\nThanks y'all!",

        "content": "What is the most common performance/enthusiast-type car in your area?. After Doug Demuro posted his highly entertaining birthday car safari video last week, I decided on my way to and from work I'd pay extra attention to the kinds of vehicles I see driving around.   It looked like it'd be a lot of fun.  And the results so far have been....disappointing.   While I have seen the occasional interesting vehicle, (The LC500H I saw was stunning; way more striking car in person than in pictures), the vast majority I see are the pony/muscle car triplets, which is no surprise considering I live in the Southeast.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut what really shocked me is the particular distribution of those three I have observed.  For every Mustang or Camaro I come across, I see five or six Challengers.   In fact, the number of Challengers I see is kind of absurd, when you consider their relative sales numbers and what I *should* be seeing based on them.    There should be way more Mustangs statistically, but it seems to be the less popular model in my area.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nToday, on the way home, on a 18 mile trip, I saw **seven Challengers**.  This is not an unusual number.  I haven't had a day where I've seen less than four of them on my commute, either way.  Of the seven today, almost all of them were straight up base V6's, with a single Scat Pack mixed in.  None of the more exotic ones were present.  Two had tacky vinyl hood wraps and side decals.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo what's the most common \"performance\" or \"enthusiast\" or just plain...not-milquetoast-commuter car in your area?  I'm kind of curious how this might differ in other places, and if maybe I just live in some kind of Challenger-purgatory.",

For those who don't know Cadillac debuted a new subscription ownership model today. $1500 per month, and you have your choice of any fully loaded Cadillac. You can switch between models anytime, up to 18 times per year. Escalade for the road trip, then right back to your cts-v platinum for your commute. All maintenance, and insurance is included in the $1500. \n\nNo long term obligation, and no worries about lease returns over mileage etc. When you are done just turn in the car. \n\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/www.theverge.com/platform/amp/2017/1/5/14177698/cadillac-book-car-subscription-service-1500-a-month?client=safari\n\nI think this may be a stroke of genius. I am certainly not in the demographic of people with $1500 per month to spend on my choice of any fully loaded Cadillac. However I think this could really translate well to other segments of the car market. This would be especially true if a company could do this across multiple brands. \n\nImagine if their was a service for say $5-600 that had a bunch of fun cars to choose from in the $30,000 range like Gtis, Tacoma's, camaros etc. Or scale it to a higher price like $7-800 for mid level luxury cars. \n\nI would be all over that to sample a bunch of different cars without the stress of dealing with a dealership Everytime, and never worrying about maintenance again. \nThe company could just do as the rental car companies do, and blow out the cars after 20,000 miles for pretty good money. \n\nI would gladly pay a few extra $$$ per month to have the flexibility of just changing cars on a whim.",

So, I\u2019ve narrowed down my car search to two solid contenders: **Tata Harrier** and **Tata Safari**. Safety is my top priority, so I\u2019m not considering any other options (XUV700 AX5 is out because of the 4-airbag setup). But now, I\u2019m stuck in a dilemma, and I need some advice!\n\n# My Situation:\n\n* **Current Family Size**: 4 members (unmarried)\n* **Future Plan**: Might go up to 5 members after marriage\n* **Driving Needs**: Max \\~500 km/month, city driving\n* **Budget**: Harrier (\u20b922.5L on-road) vs. Safari (\u20b923L on-road)\n* **Preferences**:\n   * I like the **Harrier\u2019s looks and feel** better.\n   * Safari doesn\u2019t appeal to me visually (is that just me, or do others feel the same?).\n\n# What\u2019s Holding Me Back?\n\n* The **Safari deal**: For just \u20b950,000 more, I get a **7-seater** instead of a 5-seater. Even though I don\u2019t need a 7-seater *right now*, it feels like a better value-for-money option for occasional group trips or emergencies.\n* **Boot Space**:\n   * Harrier already has good boot space for a 5-seater.\n   * Safari could offer similar practicality by folding down the rear seats when the 7-seater isn\u2019t needed.\n\n# Concerns:\n\n1. **Looks**: I find the Harrier more appealing than the Safari. Does anyone else agree, or am I overthinking?\n2. **Utility**: None of my friends own a 7-seater, so having one could make me \u201cthat guy\u201d everyone calls for group outings. Still, how often would I really need that extra seating?\n3. **Same Engine**: Both cars share the same engine, mileage, pickup, and comfort, so there\u2019s no mechanical advantage to choosing one over the other.\n\n# TL;DR:\n\nAm I being irrational for leaning towards the Harrier just because of its looks, even though the Safari offers more versatility for just \u20b950,000 extra? Or is the Harrier the better choice given my preferences and current needs?\n\nI\u2019d love to hear your thoughts!",

It feels like settling.\n\nIt feels like a choice between a car I'll love and a car that's just practical. What would you do?\n\n**TL;DR:** Need a 10-year car for a long Mumbai commute.

        "content": "[Advice] Help Me Pick My Next Car (7\u201310 Year Ownership). Hey everyone,\n\nI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever been this confused about a purchase in my life. I desperately need help making up my mind, and I know this subreddit will give me the honest takes I need.\n\n**THIS IS A REALLY LONG POST BUT THIS IS HOW CONFUSED I AM**\n\n# Background\n\nI had a Zeta Baleno MT from 2016 and sold it in 2019 due to financial problems and I regret it to this day. Now I am in a much better state and am looking to buy a car which I plan on keeping for atleast another 7-10 years. Driving has always been one of my purest joys, and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever been happier than when I was behind the wheel of that car. My wife has seen how happy I am when we rent a car out and has been forcing me to decide for the longest time. I\u2019ve been at this hunt for over 3 months now pouring in endless hours of research, test drives, YouTube reviews, and dealership visits and every time I think I\u2019m close, some new update or variant launch pulls me back into this spiral again. I\u2019m truly exhausted, but I also know this is not just about buying a car, to me, it\u2019s the most important purchase of my life, more than even a house, because this is where my happiness is.\n\n# Budget & Financing\n\n* Down payment:\u00a0**\u20b95\u201310L**\u00a0(depending on car)\n* EMI:\u00a0**Max \u20b935k/month**\u00a0(plan to close loan in 2 years)\n* I want something practical and reliable, but also something that makes me look forward to driving every day.\n\n# Shortlist (in order of preference)\n\n**Citroen Basalt**\u00a0\\-\n\nThis car stole my heart. I test-drove the pre-BasaltX version, and even without all the features, I fell in love with it. The drive, the feel, the coupe-like design\u2014ever since I saw the BMW X4 years ago, I\u2019ve dreamt of a shape like this, and the Basalt nails it at a realistic price. With the BasaltX launch, it feels like the perfect fit. My heart is completely set on it, but my mind keeps worrying about Citro\u00ebn\u2019s future in India. It\u2019s not a brand with a guaranteed 7\u201310 year presence here, and I keep wondering\u2014what if they pull out? Would I regret this every single day after? To add to that, in all these weeks I\u2019ve only seen two Basalts on Mumbai roads, both just recently. I don't know if its a sign and if so, is it to steer clear or to go for it.\n\n**Tata Safari/Harrier -**\n\nThese two black beauties have always been my crushes. Been in love with both since the time of launch and honestly, if budget allowed, I would have blindly gone for the top variant, but budget and the fear of the \"Tata Quality\" is what is keeping me hesitant\n\n**Honda Elevate -**\n\nWe used to own Honda City (Dolphin) and the boxy look of the car is something that pulled me towards it. Like I said, I have put the choices in order of my choice or likeness.\n\n**Nissan Magnite / Renault Kiger (Top Variant) -**\n\nThese tick a lot of boxes\u2014feature-packed, priced attractively, easy on the wallet. But again, that same fear of long-term brand survival in India keeps me worried. Will they still be around a decade from now?\n\n**Tata Nexon (Top Variant) -**\n\n* Objectively makes the most sense (value, safety, features).\n* But my gut just doesn\u2019t want it\u2014it feels like the \u201cdefault\u201d answer, not something special.\n\n# Cars I\u2019ve Ruled Out\n\n* Skoda Kushaq/Kodiaq & VW Taigun \u2192 Maintenance too expensive\n* Hyundai/Kia \u2192 Safety concerns\n* Maruti \u2192 Build quality not confidence-inspiring\n\n# My Non-Negotiables\n\n1. Automatic (done with manuals in Mumbai traffic). Still can\u2019t figure out what\u2019s best: TC vs CVT vs AMT vs DSG.\n2. Mileage is critical \u2192 I do \\~80\u201390 km daily (city + highway). Leaning toward diesel\n3. Must-haves: ventilated seats, 360\u00b0 camera, TPMS.\n4. High ground clearance (Mumbai potholes rule out sedans\u2014even though my heart still aches for a Civic).\n5. Infotainment with wireless CarPlay/Android Auto + good speakers.\n6. Cruise control (ADAS not required, not practical in India anyway).\n7. Solid build quality.\n\n**Additional Preferences**\n\n* Tactile buttons for AC, volume, etc. Hate full-touch systems.\n* No interest in second-hand (Mumbai floods + overpriced market = risky).\n* Would actually prefer no sunroof, but higher variants bundle it anyway.\n\n**Where I\u2019m Stuck**\n\n* Heart says Basalt.\n* Head debates Safari/Harrier vs Elevate.\n* Wallet suggests Magnite/Kiger.\n* Logic drags me to Nexon.\n\nI don\u2019t want to make the same mistake I did when I sold my Baleno. This car is going to be my companion for the next decade, through traffic jams, long drives, and everything in between. I just want to get this right.\n\n# TL;DR\n\nLooking for a 7\u201310 year car in the \u20b915\u201325L segment (\u20b95\u201310L down, \u20b935k EMI, plan to clear loan in 2 years). Daily drive: \\~80\u201390 km in Mumbai. Must-haves: automatic, diesel preferred, ventilated seats, 360 cam, TPMS, cruise control, wireless CarPlay, good build, high ground clearance.\n\n**Shortlist:**\n\n1. Citro\u00ebn Basalt (heart pick, but worried about brand future)\n2. Tata Safari/Harrier Dark (love it, but Tata niggles scare me)\n3. Honda Elevate (safe choice, but not exciting)\n4. Nissan Magnite/Renault Kiger (value, but brand survival doubtful)\n5. Tata Nexon (sensible, but uninspiring)\n\n**Ruled out:**\u00a0Skoda, VW, Hyundai, Kia, Maruti.\n\nPlease help me end this analysis paralysis \ud83d\ude4f\n\nNote: Yes I have used AI to clean the language and the post is only been done after reading through all the suggestions it gave",

Please give your openion about the colour and please tell me what colour I should choose as i planning to use it for atleast 10 years.\n\nPlease search the web for the photos to compare as i cannot see an option to attach photos here.

Would prefer something decently reliable. \n\nHere's what I've been looking at this far:\n- Mazda CX-5 or CX-8 ( petrol models, heard the diesels were unreliable)\n- P3 Gen Volvo XC-60 (T6 model only, 300hp and well regarded engine)\n-Toyota Vanguard (Rav4 with 3.5v6)\n- Lexus NX (upper limit of budget so probably can't get the hybrid)\n- Toyota Harrier (Similar to the current Venza but the slightly older JDM model 2014~)\n\n Any thoughts or suggestions?",

        "content": "Which 7 Seater EV would you choose? - Mitsubishi Outlander or Mercedes EQB? (Japan). We are currently looking into a 7 seater family car that can carry 6-7 people every few weeks.\nCurrent car is a top of the line 2015 Toyota Harrier (very comparable to Lexus RX450).\n\nThe family members are mostly Japanese and around 160cm tall (only the males are 180-190cm) and we have small children across our family and friends (0-6 years old)\nI\u2019ve been to each dealer and I am a bit split.\n\nPros on EQB:\n- It feels high quality\n- The third row seats seem more comfortable from their quality\n- It has some nice features to help navigate the narrow streets of japan, where it can tell you on the screen with a simulation if you might hit a corner or not (we hit our Toyota a few times because we couldn\u2019t properly see what we might be hitting)\n\n\nPros on Outlander:\n- Approx. $30k cheaper\n- A few features are better than EQB, such as 2nd row seat heating, better sound system (Dolby atmos) and other tiny things\n- Since it is a Japanese automaker and I am in Japan, it is fairly easy to get it serviced\n\n\nState of EV charging and lifestyle:\n- I can charge at home, either 3kw or could consider upgrading to 7kw\n- Around us are a lot of 40kw (or 50kw?) Chademo chargers if we need to charge a bit quicker\n- We would mostly drive up to 60km if we go out, rarely beyond that\n- Once or twice a year we might go for a 500km trip, anything longer than that we wouldn\u2019t really take a car anyway\n- We drive approx 7000km per year\n\n\nSo I am now wondering about what the better buy is for the next 10+ years, in terms of issues and repair costs and everything.\nOr maybe even go with a cheaper (used car?) option and buy a new 7 seater earlier since they are still coming out.\n\nEDIT:\n\nI forgot there is also the Model X and Volvo CX90 Recharge. The Model X though I doubt works well in Japanese parking spaces due to its doors. The Volvo CX90 Recharge looks great, but not sure if it\u2019s worth the price (costing twice the Outlander).",

Hi everyone,\n\nI recently bought a Nissan X-Trail (the hybrid/e-Power model) and unfortunately it\u2019s been nothing but trouble. I\u2019m now in the process of getting a refund from the dealer and I want to move on to something more reliable.\n\nI\u2019m currently considering:\n- Toyota RAV4 \n- Kia Sportage\n- Hyundai Tucson\n\nHere\u2019s what I\u2019m looking for:\n- Reliability (after my X-Trail experience, this is #1 for me)\n- Comfort (daily driving but also long trips)\n- Boot space & interior room (I have dogs and often go up to the mountains, so I need good space for gear + pets)\n- Safety \n\nSome background:\n- In the past, I\u2019ve owned a Nissan Qashqai, a Toyota Harrier, an older Toyota RAV4, and a very old Lexus. So I\u2019m familiar with Toyotas but I\u2019ve never owned a Hyundai or Kia before.\n- I want something practical but also enjoyable to drive \u2014 I don\u2019t want to make another mistake like I did with the X-Trail.\n\nFor anyone who owns or has driven these cars, what would you recommend between the RAV4, Sportage, and Tucson?\n- Which is the most reliable long term ?\n- How do they compare for comfort and interior space?\n- Any common issues I should be aware of?\n- Best value for money ?\n\nWould really appreciate your advice before I make my decision. Thanks in advance!",

        "content": "Looking for a tank with tyres.. I run a luxury safari lodge in Africa. It's in a semi-arid area near one of the continent's mightiest rivers. As a result of this, for two months of the year, the road is flooded, muddy, slippery, and insane. For ten months of the year the road is concrete-hard, with thousands upon thousands of different sized stones and river pebbles baked into it, making it the bumpiest, hardest road on earth (before even discussing the corrugation)... and insane.\n\nIt took two years for this road to chew up and spit out a Toyota Hilux 3.0 D4D, and it took the road ten months to eviscerate a brand new Isuzu D-Max. So the question is, other than an insanely expensive 79 Series Land Cruiser, is there literally any vehicle on Earth than can handle these sorts of environments? We're frequently carrying 400kg - 600kg. Is is better to just get a used UniMog at this point?\n\nEdit: Since a few of you very helpful nut and bolt types have asked on message, [here's a short video](https://streamable.com/g8yioa) I took last night of the very beginning of the road when it's still really good! This section was graded last month, but if you turn the sound up you'll hear a good rattle already. You'll also see the right hand side of the road briefly which literally can't be driven on :). I know phone video never really gets the point across in these situations but enjoy anyway.\n\nEdit 2: This is as close to a post 'blowing up' as I've ever had. Thanks for all the really awesome feedback, I've actually learned a good amount more about suspension than I knew a few hours ago! Really cool community, hope you had as much fun as I have. Pro tip, if you haven't been to places like Zambia, Namibia, and Zimbabwe and these kinda roads interest you... what are you waiting for? The wildlife is astounding too! Hopefully catch one of you in your safari-converted Miata on a road here soon!",

However, I'm leaving in four months to do my own #vanlife adventure, and it's about time I suck it up and buy a vehicle. \n\nMPG obviously factors in, and the space to stretch out (I'm only 5\"7) and store camp gear/some clothes/cooler, but most of all I'm looking for reliability. I'm going to be driving across Canada and potentially into Central America over a period of several months. \n\nThe GMC Safaris I've found I absolutely LOVE, but they're all from around '98-00 and have an average of 380,000KM on them, which I've heard is pretty bad. \n\nGrand Caravans, Honda Odysseys and (to a lesser degree) Toyota Siennas have been floating around within my budget. What's the good, the bad, and the ugly, in your opinion? \n\n(Thank you all in advance)",

For the past five years me and my BMW 528 have cruised down 30 miles of well paved country roads and it's been easy. The BMW just ate up the miles.  Now, my commute has changed - now I have 20 miles of some of the worst interstate work I've ever seen followed by some of most pothole riven city streets in the state.  No place for BMW. This commute is going to kill it.\n\nSo, what do I buy?  Needs a tough suspension. My garage is smallish, so I don't want a full sized SUV.  Nothing too flashy, I don't want it stolen.  I've also gotten pretty used to the quality work of a BMW and hate to go too far backwards (love my heated seats, steering wheel and quiet ride).  Safari on the outside, luxury on the inside - but not too big or flashy.  What do you think?",

My '91 Nissan Hardbody is my daily driver.  I also need the cargo capacity for work, personal use, and occasional camping.  It's got about 271k miles on it, and it could run forever or die tomorrow.\n\nLong term, the plan is to have 3 vehicles, a daily driver for us both and a shared utility/beater car.  I need to worry about the vehicle I use for work before I get a sporty project, so here we are.\n\nThis vehicle needs to tow at least 5k lbs to accommodate future camper trailer plans.  It also needs to accommodate a 6' person laying down in it.  I want the smallest and best handling vehicle that meets those requirements, as I'll be driving it primarily in the city, often down alleys.  Unless it'd make a good daily and is actually fun to drive, it should be <$5k, but I'll pay the price for the right thing.  I can work on it myself, older vehicles are fine.\n\nChevy Astro/GMC Safari currently top my list.  Wouldn't mind another pickup.  I'd love the Honda Element, but it can't pull the trailer, so I'd have to upgrade it someday.  Any ideas?",

        "content": "22 year old guy looking to buy my first car after driving parents' cars for years. Considering \"hatchback\" coupes.. The first car I drove at 16 was my grandfather's shitty old [Buick Century](https://static.cargurus.com/images/site/2009/03/23/19/54/2005_buick_lesabre_custom-pic-987-1600x1200.jpeg). Then I drove a hand-me-down [2-door 2000 Ford Explorer](http://o.aolcdn.com/commerce/autodata/images/CAB00FOS101A0101.jpg) for a few years. For the last few months I've been driving my dad's [2006 4-door Explorer](https://media.ed.edmunds-media.com/ford/explorer/2006/oem/2006_ford_explorer_4dr-suv_limited_s_oem_1_500.jpg). \n\nI'm now in the market to buy my first proper car. My parents have generously agreed to contribute around $10k. Anything beyond that is on me - I can certainly manage a few grand, but honestly looking around I'm pretty sure I can get a great car for not much over $10k.\n\nMe:\n\n* I'm about to graduate college and live in a city. As far as I know I'll be living here for a while, but of course it's hard to know for sure at this point in life. \n* I don't really like driving very much, but maybe that's because I've never had my own car to love. \n* I'm an engineer and am definitely mechanically minded, but have never worked much on cars. I'd love to learn.\n* I like camping and outdoors stuff every now and then, but don't go too often.\n* I'm a musician and may need to haul music gear.\n* I've only driven a stick shift on a handful of occasions, but buying one is not out of the question. I'm not sure if it would make me dislike driving even more, or make me have more fun.\n\nI actually really liked having the 2-door explorer, even though it's kind of an oddity. I've always liked smaller cars, and feel more comfortable driving them in the city because parking and maneuvering is so much easier. I liked that it had plenty of storage room if you put down the seats, but could fit 4 (or maybe 5) people when you had the seats up. I didn't like the full explorer because it's so big.\n\nWith those things in mind, I've been considering some 2-door cars with better-than-average storage space:\n\n* [~2010 Ford Focus Coupe](http://st.motortrend.com/uploads/sites/10/2015/11/2010-ford-focus-se-coupe-side-view.png).\n* [~2007 Scion tC](https://www.google.com/search?q=2000+ford+explorer&client=safari&rls=en&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiR35nNgqzUAhXJYyYKHbPcB98Q_AUICigB&biw=1039&bih=665#tbm=isch&q=2007+scion+tc&imgrc=y1MeogC-TxqbVM:). Is this thing worth it? People shit on Scion, but others say they're just rebranded Toyotas (and therefore are reliable).\n\nI've been told to stay away from European cars for reliability reasons as a first car and daily driver.\n\nAm I crazy to want a 2-door car? I know most people want coupes because they're sportier and are wannabe sports cars, but I really don't care much about that - I just don't really like hauling around more steel than necessary. Engineering mindset, I guess...\n\nMaybe y'all can give me some options for 4-door hatchbacks that don't feel too large. \n\nThanks for reading this long post.\n\nEdit PS: If I hadn't been warned against older European cars and guided towards practicality, I would still be looking at the BMW 3-series E30, either the sedan or coupe/vert.",

Good evening all,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am chasing my dream job as a teacher out in a remote Australian community and a prerequisite is owning a four wheel drive. The snag; I know embarrassingly little about cars and significantly less about 4x4's.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/md8uf9pozbv91.png?width=284&format=png&auto=webp&s=a5394dbf0241cb4dccacb7fdba25d68a93b5cb96\n\n**Budget:**\n\n$10,000-$17,500 (that's Dollaridoos btw)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Strategy:**\n\nThe conservative budget is due to my inexperience and the fact that I am humble enough to know that teachers out remote have a high bail rate. So while I think i've got the goods there is a significant chance I'll be returning to a major city where a safari snorkel is going to get limited use.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Current front runner:**\n\n2007 Land Rover Discovery 3 SE Auto 4x4 MY08\n\n333,000km Odometer\n\n6cyl 4.0L petrol engine\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Key features:**\n\nARB Bull Bar, Under body Armour, 115 litre Brown Davies Tank with electric transfer pump. Redarc brake controller, dual battery system including Anderson plug for solar charging, brand new kings driving lights, safari snorkel, rear draws, Also Recently fitted with Brand new original 4 coil air bag suspension including compressor and sensors, also a genuine electric hand brake assembly\n\n**Misc:**\n\n\\- Brake assist - Side airbags - Passenger airbag - Rollover stability control - Driver airbag - Rain Sensor Wipers - Premium Harman Kardon Audio sytem - Parking Sensors - Leather Trim -All In beautiful condition throughout\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo the question I'm asking really is what criticisms do you have of this car and my overall strategy?\n\nAm i significantly better off spending a bit more, or should this suffice in the short term?\n\nEdit: is it missing any essentials I didn't consider?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBless you and your apt automotive appraisals,\n\nMr X",

It's our third Golf GTI; we absolutely love them and have kept upgrading over the years. It especially made sense for the 10+ years that we lived in San Francisco. We split all costs evenly and take good care of it (pretty much just curb rash on the wheels and apart from that, it's as good as new, with 35K miles on it).\n\nRecently we moved from San Francisco to Sacramento and were gifted a 2003 GMC Safari cargo van by a family member. It has over 130K miles and has been treated just *okay.* It probably always passed smog, but there's interior/exterior damage, the windshield needs to be replaced, it's slow and clunky to operate, etc.\n\nBecause of COVID keeping us home all the time and in order to save money (we'll call it savings of about $550 a month), he wants to sell the Golf and use the GMC as our exclusive vehicle. We're not in dire straits or anything, this is just a cost-saving mechanism, but if we sell the Golf now, we would not be able to buy another vehicle for the foreseeable future.\n\nSo with this in mind, what are some fair arguments *against* his decision? Or if you're in agreement, what are some fair arguments *for* it? Anyone know of some sort of cost/benefit analysis exercise that I can do? Thanks.",

Am I overpaying for this van for the amount of miles on it? I am looking around Milwaukee, WI which means that all the vans have some rust on them.

A few questions a) at a used car lot is it the seller's responsibility to provide a smog certificate? aside from this and the 'pink slip', are there any other documents we need to be sure to receive with purchase, I have found these details a little hard to determine b) any miscellaneous tips for someone unfamiliar with the buying process in the US that may not be included in the buying guide in the side bar? c) Here's an example of what kinds of vehicles we are thinking of checking out when we arrive if you have any suggestions/warnings to add I'd appreciate it very much: https://www.cargurus.com/Cars/l-Used-1997-GMC-Safari-3-Dr-SLE-Passenger-Van-Extended-t5544#listing=145901840",

I'm looking for a forever car for my daily commute, but I'm stuck in analysis paralysis after 3 months of searching.\n\n**My Basics:**\n\n* **Budget:** \u20b95\u201310L down, \u20b935k EMI max (loan closed in 2 years). \n* **Usage:** \\~80\u201390 km daily in Mumbai (mix of city + highway). \n* **Ownership:** Plan to keep 7\u201310 years.\n\n# The Contenders:\n\n**Citro\u00ebn Basalt**\n\n* **Pros:** Stunning coupe design, fantastic drive, feels unique.\n* **Cons:** Citro\u00ebn's future in India. Just ONE service center for all of Mumbai/Navi Mumbai/Thane (40km from my home). Am I buying a future nightmare?\n\n**Tata Safari/Harrier**\n\n* **Pros:** Unmatched road presence, premium feel, great diesel AT.\n* **Cons:** Worried about Tata's long-term reliability and niggles. Selecting this stretches the budget.\n\n**Honda Elevate**\n\n* **Pros:** Bulletproof Honda reliability and service network. Total peace of mind.\n* **Cons:** The drive felt competent but totally uninspiring. I don't want to feel \"meh\" about my car for a decade.\n\n**Nissan Magnite / Renault Kiger**\n\n* **Pros:** Amazing VFM. Loaded with features, fun turbo engines.\n* **Cons:** Same as Citro\u00ebn \u2013 will the brands even be in India by the time I'm done with the car?\n\n**The Logic: Tata Nexon**\n\n* **Pros:** Objectively checks every box for safety, features, and value.\n* **Cons:** Inspires zero passion in me. It feels like settling.\n\nIt feels like a choice between a car I'll love and a car that's just practical. What would you do?\n\n**TL;DR:** Need a 10-year car for a long Mumbai commute. My heart loves the risky Citro\u00ebn Basalt. My head leans towards the impressive but potentially niggle-prone Tata Harrier/Safari. Logic points to reliable but boring options.",

Kinda proud moment ngl for a person who admires Tata motors (have a good past experience as well)\ud83d\ude04\n\nI know it\u2019s early and not many test drives are out yet, but the specs look solid \u2013 dual motor setup, 14.5\u201d touchscreen, ADAS, and even a 540\u00b0 camera.

I knew Tata usually does well with safety, but this one\u2019s not even launched yet, I remember casually checking out the EV version at a display a while ago and thinking \u201clooks futuristic but probably gonna take ages to prove itself.\u201d But now with this rating\u2026 it\u2019s kinda setting expectations real high before even hitting the roads.\n\nAlso does this mean the safety structure is completely different from the ICE Harrier or is it built off the same base? I get confused with these things.\n\nCurious to hear what you all think especially from the safety-first crowd here.",

Hi everyone,\n\nJust wanted to share my extremely disappointing and frustrating experience with JP Motors \u2013 Tata Car Dealership in Solan, Himachal Pradesh, and Tata Motors itself. I had booked a Tata Harrier Adventure Plus Dark Edition in June, but what followed was a series of mismanagement, lies, and unethical behavior \u2014 and now I\u2019m stuck chasing a refund of \u20b921,000 that I paid in advance.\n\n**It started in Nov 2024...**  \nI first visited JP Motors in November 2024 because I was genuinely interested in the Harrier. But my experience at the dealership was immediately bad \u2014 no one attended to me for a long time, and even when I got someone to talk to, they didn\u2019t have a Harrier available for test drive.   \nAfter several follow-ups, I was finally told to come down for a test drive, but when I reached the showroom (having left work and asked my father to take time out too), they casually said \"the battery is dead\" \u2014 completely unprepared and unprofessional.  \nDespite this, I still liked the car and was willing to give it another shot. Later, the salesman arranged a test drive for my father (when I was out of town), and he liked the car. So I went ahead and made the booking on 5th June 2025, paying a \u20b921,000 advance.\n\n**Delivery Promised in 20\u201325 Days... and Then the Delays Started**\n\nI was told the car would be delivered by end of June, so I planned my leaves accordingly as I work out of town.  \nBut not once did the dealership call us for updates. We had to call them ourselves every few days \u2014 and each time we were given a new excuse and new delivery date:  \n2nd July \u2192 10th July \u2192 14th July \u2192 16th July \u2192 finally 17th July  \nAnd for a long time they kept telling us our car was in transit when it was not even alloted from plant yet which we got to know later.  \nOther excuses included \"car not allotted,\" \"truck breakdown,\" \"vehicle stuck in transit,\" etc. We had zero clarity, and the dealership kept lying about the car\u2019s status.  \nThis also disrupted our other plans which we planned according to their initial committed date\n\n**What Happened on Delivery Day (17th July) Was Unbelievable**\n\nOn 17th July, they told us the car had arrived and asked us to come see it. We went to the yard and saw the car being unloaded \u2014 and to our shock, it was dirty from inside.  \nThey said they would clean it, do PDI, and bring it to the showroom. So we waited.When we got tired of waiting, we went to the workshop, and that\u2019s where things got completely unethical.  \nWe found an employee rubbing black paint with a cloth on the car. When asked, he said he was \u201cdoing final touches.\u201d  \nBut this was clearly being done to hide scratches and defects. And even after that, we found a big dent and multiple scratches on the car.  \nNo one informed us about this instead when i confronted them about rubbing black paint on car they just blatantly refused to acknowledge that \u2014 they were just trying to quietly cover it up and hand over the car.\n\n**That Was the Last Straw \u2013 I Cancelled the Booking Immediately**\n\nThis was beyond unacceptable. I had waited over 6 weeks, been lied to repeatedly, and then was almost handed over a damaged car with cover-ups.  \nSo I cancelled the booking immediately on 17th July and submitted a written cancellation letter. I was told I would get the \u20b921,000 refund within 7 days.\n\n**I Also Wrote a Formal Complaint to Tata Motors \u2013 No Response Till Date**\n\nOn the same day, I sent a detailed email to [customercare@tatamotors.com](mailto:customercare@tatamotors.com) with everything \u2014 including photos of the workshop scene and the advance receipt.That was 10 days ago. No one has replied. No acknowledgment.This is shocking even from a brand like Tata.\n\n**Refund Still Not Issued**\n\nEven thought the cancellation letter with all facts was submitted on 17th July I still havent recieved my refund.  \nWhen I follow up with the dealership, they just say:  \n\"We\u2019ll do it by end of the month.\"  \n\"Money is with company not with us,it takes time\"  \n\"Our owner is not here\"\n\nIt\u2019s been over a month since I paid the advance, and over 10 days since cancellation, and they are just refusing to return my money on time.  \nWhat should I do next? Any suggestions are welcome \u2014 whether it\u2019s raising a complaint with consumer forum, legal route, or any Tata escalation channel that actually works.",

Although oem touch screen (7 in) is there but it does not support cameras and also does not have carplay/android auto. I dont want android stereo. Oem sound quality is very good.\n\n2. I want a good dual channel dashcam also.\n\n3. Any reliable gps tracker. OBD based ones like jiomotive are useless in name of security.\n\n4. I don't want to change/alter oem wiring.\n\n---- is there any solution that can give me android auto/carplay, reverse camera, dual dashcam all in one.\nI am attaching photo of dashboard also.\n\n5. Is there any solution that can work as reverse cam, carplay/android, dual channel dashcam.\n\n6. Car seat- i have basic fabric seats. Don't want to spoil oem seats by bucket fitting gimmick (taking out Tubes and placing in new seat cover). However, open to the method in which needle and thread used to give bucket fit effect.\nBest options for seat cover materials.\n\n7. Floor matting? And which one to get?\n\n8. Any auto dimming irvm solution?\n\n9. Grainy texture of dashboard. Cannot use suction cup type mobile holders. Suggestions if any, tried car vent type once but placement is low.\n\nThanks in advance.",

Manual transmission would be too much effort in city traffic so going for an automatic.I have narrowed down the choices to Mahindra 3XO AX5L Automatic (12.25 lakhs ex-showroom after discount and GST reduction) and Skoda Slavia Sportline 1.5 DSG Petrol (15.3 lakhs ex-showroom after discount and GST reduction). 3XO is a proper 5 seater for adults but with limited bootspace, Slavia has better bootspace but is comfortable for 4 adults and a kid.\n\nAfter the GST cut, diesel Automatic variants of Scorpio N, XUV700, Tata Safari with 6 airbags and other necessary features are available within 18L ex-showroom post discount, which I have the budget for. They supposedly give 12-13 kmpl in city, 18-20 kmpl on highways. They offer a lot of rear seat space as well as boot space when you are not using the 3rd row. Thinking about using it as a 5 seater most of the time which can accommodate more people if required, like extended family visiting. Thinking about Diesel so the mileage isn't bad for a big car. \n\nI would be using the car for office travel in Bangalore's bumper to bumper traffic twice or thrice a week. Will be going out on weekends with family but in the city itself. Will be travelling with family on occasional long trips (within 500 KMs mostly).",

        "content": "Visit to Sanjay Gandhi National Park (SGNP) : Everything you need to know!. I'd been meaning to visit SGNP for ages, and finally, I made it happen! Let me tell you, it didn't disappoint.\nThis post is my way of paying it forward, giving you all the details you need to plan your own incredible SGNP adventure.\n\n\nTotal Cost ~\nIncluding travel, camera, food, and entry and exploration fees - Approximately 899\u20b9 per person\n\n\nNow let me elaborate...\n\n\nTravel ~\nMetro (very convenient)\nVersova-Western Express Highway-Rashtriya Udyan\n(40\u20b9+60\u20b9 - one way)\nIt is a 4-5 mins walk from the metro station\n\n\nSGNP Entry Fees - 103\u20b9\nCamera Charges - 285\u20b9\n\n\nFrom here you have many options to explore the national park -\n\n\u2014>Bus (50\u20b9) (AC) (includes return) We took this bus, really comfortable, highly recommend it if you have less time on your hands, Takes 20 minutes to go and 20 minutes to return, and stops at Lion and Tiger Safari and Boating while returning.\n\n\u2014> BEST Bus (AC) (14\u20b9) (includes return) This is a good option too but the windows are smaller so the scenic route is something you will miss out on.\n\n\u2014> Cycling (45\u20b9) Rent cycles from the park itself, not from outside, I would only recommend this mode of transport if you have the stamina to ride for 7kms to Kanheri Caves, It's not a very straight route, If you are not visiting Kanheri, Cycling short distances is a good idea.\n\n\u2014> Walking, Again, If you are not planning to go to Kanheri, You can stroll around, go Boating, go to the Butterfly Garden, Fragrance Garden, etc.\n\n\nOnce you reach the Kanheri Caves entrance don't forget to try these out from the stalls\n\u2014> Star Fruit (20\u20b9) 8.5/10\n\n\u2014> Watermelon (30\u20b9) 9/10\n\n\u2014> Chana Masala (30\u20b9) 10/10\n\n\u2014> Love Apple/White Jamun (20\u20b9) 7/10\n\nWe were enjoying the beautiful Kanheri Caves when a cheeky monkey decided our starfruit and jamun looked like the perfect snack.  He wasn't wrong, they were delicious! \ud83d\ude09\n\n\nKanheri Caves ~\nEntrance Fees\n\n\u2014> Indian Citizens - 25\u20b9\n\n\u2014> Foreign Citizens - 300\u20b9\n(really unfair.)\n\nThere are 3 trails you can follow to explore Kanheri Caves. There are a total of 109 Caves, really beautiful and intricate. You can explore as many as you can and wish to till 5:30 pm. We were there for 1 hour.\n\n\nLion and Tiger Safari ~\nWe got down and took the bus to go back to the main entrance, stopping at the Lion and Tiger Safari (136\u20b9). It is a 25 to 30-minute ride going and coming.\nThe lions were sleeping, so didn\u2019t get to see much there, but a tiger was walking right outside our bus and it was so magnificent.\nThere were other tigers too but were resting inside, probably because it was afternoon time (1 pm)\n\n\nAfter this safari, we got on the bus to take us back towards the main entrance, it stopped for people who wanted to get down for boating, but we didn\u2019t have much time on our hands so skipped that, but it looked pretty fascinating.\nSo yes, even tho we didn\u2019t explore everything, whatever we did in 3 hours was worth it. Really fun especially if you are going with your partner or your friends.\n\n\nTips and Tricks ~\n\n\u2014> Carry cash, there is no network at many places and therefore online transactions do not go through.\n\n\u2014> Carry at least one bottle of water especially if you plan on walking/cycling/going to Kanheri Caves\n\n\u2014>  Wear sunglasses/cap, it gets quite sunny after 10 AM.\n\n\u2014> Wear comfortable walking shoes.\n\n\u2014> Rent Cycles inside SNGP, not from outside the park as they overcharge as well as scam you sometimes from what is known.\n\n\u2014> Carry snacks/food of your own choice if you are planning to spend an entire day there, if not, they do have titbits such as fresh fruits, chana masala, pav bhaji, etc.\n\n\nSanjay Gandhi National Park is a true gem in Mumbai's crown.  I hope you enjoy your visit as much as I did!",

We have plane tickets and hotel already booked. I\u2019m struggling with the Safari booking though. We were able to get our friends sister (lives in Mumbai) to book a daytime safari on one day, but she and us are having trouble booking an evening safari for the 6th. It will let me fill all the information out, but requires an OTP, which I cannot get no matter what I try. \n\nHoping for some tips or tricks? Or someone who knows someone? \n\nThank you so much!",

        "content": "Need help with discussing something complex. Been a long time lurker of this sub but never thought I'd be using it for this purpose anyway the  conundrum I have is pretty complex to me and this is pretty much my last resort so here goes nothing. So I'm a transportation designer who graduated a year back and I'm in the process of completing my portfolio which is where the issue starts and ends, so to explain the problem I will need to provide some context, I have a limited time frame to complete my portfolio and as for the deadline my visa expiries in Jan '23 so will have to finish something or have something concrete before the year ends. I have to do a bunch of concept cars in that duration and that's what really confusing to me, I have this one shot at completing my portfolio with concepts that both make sense and show my skill in all mediums be it 2D, 3D, visualization and the pressure of doing it right correctly along with it being my only opportunity to do it makes me feel confuse on which concepts I should do and for which brand. I have my own personal preferences and down below I will share the list of what I have and what I want to do, ultimately I'm afraid I won't make the right choice and I know I will only know if I try but I really don't want to stir the philosophical pot, just want to do logical reasoning with someone who knows a bit about design or automotive or just knows what they are talking about. \n\nI have 2 concepts \"ready\" at the moment and a third one is one I'm doing with someone so not worried about that. I need around 5 more concepts and really confused on what to pick. The two I have are a Hyundai 2027 Supercar concept  and a Polestar 2035  hyper car concept and the other one being a Suzuki 2035 SUV. I have a liking towards French manufacturers so I want to do something for Citro\u00ebn and Bugatti, for the former one I have a vision gran Turismo type ( single seater) idea as it has not been done for Citro\u00ebn and I'm confused as to what I can offer for the latter one considering all this one thing that sticks out is most of the concepts are all fast looking aggressive cars so to offset it will need to do something mobility driven or living room on wheels type. I have a Faraday Future mobility concept that I could work on but it offers pretty much nothing new. All in all I'm pretty sure you're confused too with this horrible structure but I honestly don't know how to explain this and talking to my friends or fellow designer doesn't help either because of the competitive nature of it or simple they cant relate to the issue. Having a mentor would help but I don't have the liberty to have one or the time to pursue one. \n\nhere's the following list of what I have the options for but no clue on what to pursue. \n\nFerrari Testarossa concept  \nHyundai 2027 Northstar - Northstar GT4 - \u2714  \nBMW M9 - M9 GT3  \nCitroen G0 vision GT  \nPolestar HYPCR 2035 - \u2714  \nPolestar GT - GT Performance  \nSuzuki KUMA - Urban & Trail  \nSuzuki NEXA Ronin  \nFaraday future FFT  \nPorsche Dakar - safari - safari turbo  \nNASA Roborace 2035 - Mk01 / Mk02  \n100m Yatch  \nGAC design mobility  \nBugatti(?)  \nAudi 2035 RS6 \n\nAny suggestions or addition to the list helps. Thank you for your time.",

During my recent road trip covering several important locations, the experience on the stretch between Mumbai and Dahanu was disappointing due to poorly planned road concretisation. The journey, which began at 5:15 AM from Mumbai, took more than 6 hours just to cross the Gujarat border, despite only a single halt for breakfast near Virar. The road construction work was chaotic, with uneven surfaces and poorly managed diversions, creating significant delays and discomfort.\n\nHowever, once I entered Gujarat, the driving experience improved remarkably. The roads were well-maintained, allowing smooth travel through various destinations:\n\n\t\u2022\tDahanu Mahalaxmi Temple\n\t\u2022\tPoicha Swaminarayan Temple\n\t\u2022\tStatue of Unity along with the Jungle Safari\n\t\u2022\tPavagarh Mahakali Temple\n\t\u2022\tDakor Ranchodrai Temple\n\t\u2022\tManilaxmi Jain Tirth\n\t\u2022\tVadodara Atladara Swaminarayan Temple\n\nThe difference in road quality between Maharashtra and Gujarat was striking, with Gujarat\u2019s infrastructure providing a hassle-free driving experience. Despite the frustrating start, the overall trip was enriching, covering spiritual sites, cultural landmarks, and scenic attractions, concluding back in Mumbai.",

        "content": "Bangalore is getting grid-locked in cars parked on the road. When we say encroachment, most people think of poor shanties (and rich bungalows) on lake beds. But there is a far more dangerous encroachment on that's going unpunished. It is the rich who are encroaching our roads with parking.\n\nIn the last few months, the number of people deciding that they have a right to park on the road outside their homes has increased dramatically. Look at areas in Indiranagar, New Tippasandra and Koramangala, and you'll see that most roads have become single file because people park outside their homes. Are their vehicles blocking traffic or causing inconvenience? Who cares? So what if the other half of the road is dug up? People will still park outside their homes and not shift an inch!\n\nI'm not even talking about valet parking in these areas for customers. These are cars that have been parked because there is no parking inside the premises. It's become such a menace that in some areas, we see two lines of vehicles parked on either side. I doubt even ambulances or fire engines can cross some of these roads.\n\nThere should be a special heavy penalty on people parking huge vehicles like Tata Safari, Fortuners, XUV700, Thar, Volvo and Innovas around corners. You can hardly see incoming traffic in turns. If you can spend so much money buying a car, you better have parking inside your premises. \n\nPeople will quickly make an argument about them paying taxes and having a right to this. I pay taxes as well, but I park inside my building within my alloted parking spots. I ask visitors to park in areas where they don't inconvenience others. \n\nEven worse is that after the ruckus around towing in no parking areas, the rich have been emboldened to park anywhere, and pick up quarrels with anyone who questions them. Bangalore Traffic Police seems too stretched to do anything about this. And our political leaders have grand visions about building tunnel roads and flyovers, while letting this go unpunished.\n\nIn a year or so, I foresee that we will all be crawling on all roads because of unpunished parking. Unless these guys are fined now, and heavily, this will just grow. We'll have poeple dying because ambulances and fire engines are not able to get through and children being forced to spend additional hours in school buses because their buses are slowed to a crawl. But who cares? I have money, so I have a right to the road.\n\nOn a sadistic note, we should have a rule that if you park on the roads overnight, any damage to your car is your own responsibility, and will not be covered by insurance.",

        "content": "Anyone checked out the horrendous Kannada dubbed Spiderman :: Homecoming?. So I am still getting used to other language shows being dubbed into Kannada which is honestly so weird sometimes... Of course dubbing has been common in other languages and I am not sure how those viewers feel but I usually watch any show/movie in its own native language which IMO is the best way to go. May not catch everything but Hey! I can learn something new.\n\nBut I am really really not happy with the quality of dubbing of some of my favorite shows. Its just garbage. Ignoring the voice acting (which doesn't work at all) the many nuances in the original, the cultural references, the subtle jokes, and sometimes the whole meaning is lost. I get it, its almost impossible to get the right translation for rhyming words for example, but if the people behind the dubbing are completely oblivious to the culture the movie is based in and the theme of it, all you will end up with is crap like Spider-man Homecoming.\n\nI didn't bother watching more than 20 mins of it before I gave up, but there is one line in that that is downright offensive and just stupid for this movie in particular. Judge for yourselves.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n(Takes place in 1st half) \n\nPeter and Ned (his healthy friend) are exercising in the school basketball court and Liz and her friends are sitting in the stands chatting about superheros.\n\nLooks like Liz has a crush on Spiderman! Oh! How well he fought four robbers stealing ATM machine!\n\n\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\n\nBoy : Ohhh... She's crushing on Spiderman..\n\nBetty : No way.. \n\nLiz: Kind of..\n\nBoy: You didn't even know how he looks like\n\nBetty: He's probably like 30.\n\nBoy: And what if his face is like all burnt?!\n\n\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe Kannada translation has one key change however\n\n\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\n\nBoy : Ohhh... She's crushing on Spiderman..\n\nBetty : No way.. \n\nLiz: Kind of..\n\nBoy: You didn't even know how he looks like\n\nBetty: He's probably like 30.\n\nBoy: AND WHAT IF HIS FACE IS ALL BLACK??!\n\n\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYes people, \"what if his face is like all burnt?\"  got translated to \"what is face is black?\". And that aired on prime TV watched by kids across the state. Apparently black/dark face is equivalent to burnt face (no offense to burnt faces) and should be avoided at all costs especially in dating.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNot only is this blatantly racist, it is just wrong on so many levels.\n\n1. First of all girls are not as obsessed as guys are with color. Works with Indians and American Blacks.\n2. The kids in movie are in the US. No one will EVER say this statement in public unless they want a flurry of black fists raining on them.\n3. The boy is telling this to Liz, played by Laura Harrier, who is black actress. WHY THE FCUK WOULD A BLACK GIRL HAVE A PROBLEM IF THE GUY IS ALSO BLACK ???\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't know man... This shows how absent minded the team behind the dubbing is about the culture in which the movie is based in. Also when the hell will Kannada industry grow out of the fair skin obsession I don't know. In fact I don't even care about the obsession... It is the blatant racism against darker skin that really pisses me off... \n\nPlease share the word about this dubbed version of movie. This is by no means healthy and hope more people can at least realize that this is a problem.",

        "content": "Anybody interested in a drive around Chikkaballapur's grape farms on Sunday?. The idea is to be at the Airport toll plaza by 11am, hop into the car and continue in the Hyd highway. Take a deviation at the Chikkaballapur exit, and drive around the interior roads. We may or may not get down and go inside the farms as they require taking permission from the farmers. I'll try but no guarantees.\n\nThese days farmers have started growing other crops as well in place of grapes; dragon fruit, pomegranate, etc. Walking around these are not as pleasant though as there is no shade especially if it's sunny. Given there were lots of rains recently, there are other crops as well. Tomatoes, beans, bitter gourd, etc. All in all, it's a good time to drive around and see the countryside.\n\nAs of now another redditor has 80% confirmed. She will confirm for sure by Friday. So it's me and her (early 40s/late 30s); both introverts. I'll be driving a 2024 Automatic Harrier. Fully equipped with essentials.\n\nLooking for 2 more people. Preferably middle aged.\n\nDM me if interested.",

        "content": "Thread idea to Discuss/List out Flooded areas. Hello all,\n\nI have an idea to have a list of most of our areas in Bengaluru which are currently flooded due to ongoing heavy rains. This might be useful for the people to plan their travel who REALLY need to venture out for any important work.\n\nMy motivation in this matter is one of my close Aunts have come down to Bengaluru from Mumbai for her M.Sc. Nursing Final Exams. We reside in Hebbal (Dasarahalli) and she has to travel all the way to Binny Mills area (behind Majestic) for her exams at \"Nightingale Institute of Nursing\". It's a 14-15km journey and Ola-Uber may turn out to be unreliable, and may become hopeless if the rains worsen in the coming days.\n\n_My experience today:_\nTonight only we'd made a _wrong decision_ to walk to Coffee Board Layout in an Udupi Upchar eatery for dinner while it was raining. While coming back, we had to walk in the rain with our umbrella, and had to maneuver over invisible potholes. No electricity in the locality, no street lights. My spectacles had fogged up. It was extremely difficult to see. I was reliant on the flashes of Lightning \u26a1 and random vehicles' headlights to see and remember where the potholes could be. It almost felt like a night-time jungle safari on hard mode! Obviously we did not get Uber-Ola and the road in front of us was getting waterlogged and gushing with rain water while only a few vehicles (1-2 vehicles per 10 minutes) waded through that water. It was difficult especially for my mother and my aunt.\n\nSo, i propose to create a thread for listing flooded areas, and how deep in the water there. We already have been issued an Orange Alert due to heavy rains in the coming days. I believe this might be helpful to a number of Bangloreans.\n\n\n_EDIT:_\n\n* If such thread already exists, please share the link in the comments.\n* Feel free to list/describe in the comments about the areas that you find waterlogged.",

So I'm going to Bangalore for 3 weeks in a week, for business meetings etc. It's my first trip outside Europe, so I'm quite nervous :). I have some questions, could you be so kind to help me?\n\n1. It's monsoon season, but still hot - what kind of clothes/shoes I should take with me? Keep in mind, that around 30 celsius is hot summer weather for me :)\n2. Women attire at work - in Poland we don't have strickt rules, if we don't meet with clients (I don't and I won't). In summer, I wear knee-high dresses, sometimes without sleeves (not macaroni straps, just no sleeves) - will it be ok in India?\n3. Attire outside work - knee-high shorts, sleeveless shirts - will it be OK?\n4. Taxis - I'm going to land in a middle of a night at Bangalore airport, and I don't want to be ripped off :) what kind of transportation should I choose?\n5. Women safety - I'm going to Bangalore with 2 male work colleageus, from some sites I read that Bangalore is safe, from other.. not so much. I would like to hear some inside knowlege, especially from women\n6. Tipping - should I leave tips in restaurants, of for cleaning crew in a hotel? If so, how much?\n7. What to enjoy :) We have weekends off, so I want to see as much as I can :) I checked that there is a zoo in a safari style, I want to go there for sure :) .",

Was wondering if you could give me some suggestions on getting the most of these places if its too much travelling then may be I will stick to one place.\n\nFYI I have never been to any of these places before so no idea. Just I keep coming across some short videos of how the place is filled with mountains and beautiful greenery.\n\nWhat I want to do is within 2 days and here I need your advice\n- Hike a hikeable Hill which won't completely drain me.\n- Visit local monuments\n- Waterfall and Lakes or Dam\n- Amazing Roads to ride my bike\n- Affordable place to stay\n\n\nI heard there is a jungle safari I might go and try that (What are your experiences?)\n\nNote: I am doing my own research as well just that its my first time and I don't really know kannada I would love your suggestions to make the most out of these places.\n\nThank you.",

I am in process of finalizing my car and have visited all brand showrooms except the luxury ones.\n\nI can afford any car upto xuv700 but I feel car as a depreciating asset and since my usage is less (like 200km a month) and also I do not enjoy driving much. So I was looking for a compact suv in 10-12 lakh budget\n\nMy experience with showrooms has been terrible. The sales folks will not greet you properly, they will not explain you features of the car from base to top variant, they only display top variant and you don't know what kind of car you are getting.\n\nThey treat you like shit. I liked Grand Vitara and was ready to book the base variant which would cost 13.5 lakhs. The moment I told I want to book base, they started pushing me for next variant for 15.5 lakhs. When I refused, they were not respectful. As if 13.5 lakhs is not real money and the top-up 2 lakhs is the actual money!\n\nAnd never make the mistake of visiting the same showroom twice unless you are going to book on that day. \n\nA person is going to buy 13 lakh worth of car and gets no respect or proper communication. I had same experiences with Tata, Kia and Mahindra showrooms also.\n\nIs this some kind of marketing tactic or car showroom people are just too arrogant with booming sales.",

Hi Guys,\n\nOur newly bought July 2023 Tata Safari Red Dark edition (DL10CW2155) got stolen from our home parking in Delhi this morning. The thief broke the drivers window and took the car within minutes. When we check the CCTV footage, they came in White Creta with tools and gears.\n\nI got the immobilization event 2-3 hours after my car was gone from our house. We tried all what we could do from the iRA app, but nothing worked. We called Tata customer care, but they also couldn't track the car. I'm so angry and disheartened that I spent a ton of my savings to buy the car and it got stolen in minutes. TATA iRA didn't work. What all was advertised while buying the car got shattered in minutes.\n\nLast location it showed was in Azadpur, Delhi. We went to the location, searched like anything, but we couldn't find anything. We raised the FIR then and informed the insurance company after the incident. I read the news recently that one car gets stolen in Delhi every 14 mins. I feel so unsafe right now that I question what all we pay so hefty tax for. No safety and no responsibility from public departments. Our hard earned money just got wasted for nothing.\n\nI have lost the hope in finding my car, but if anyone finds or see any trace of car, please DM.\n\nChassis Number: \\*\\*\\*631047P\\*\\*\\*\\*804\n\nNote: I would be really thankful, if any leads/help/references that any one of you have that could lead me to find the car.",

Hello delhites,  \n\nI'm slightly nervous and anxious about driving this slight big car.\n\nThe thing is that I know how to drive and all but those were small cars, whose bonnet was not visible but now I have to drive this Harrier and it's bonnet is very big and I'm getting anxious about driving it.\n\nMoreover I'm confused about it's left side judgement, I mean in those small cars we used to take the reference point from the middle of the dashboard. But in this vehicle with huge bonnet from where should I take the reference point, From middle of the dashboard or middle of the bonnet, for driving in tight spaces.\n\nI'm so anxious and nervous that I feel extremely under confident, it just feels like I haven't drove any thing and I have to start from scratch again, just to understand the measurements of this vehicle.\n\nSorry for the long paragraph, but experienced drivers, guide me please.",

Hello Delhites,\n\nThe best part of moving to Delhi was its proximity to countless tourist locations (hill stations, national park, historical places).\n\nBut honestly most of these places (like Shimla, Mussorie, Rishikesh) are over-commercialised.\n\nI am a type of guy who travels to have some peace. I travel to explore the local culture and stories.\n\nLast time I visted Nagthat, a small hill village in Uttarakhand. I stayed at a homestay that had hill views from window. The locals there took me to a waterfall that is still remains unexplored by tourists. Had lunch with locals, visited the local diety temple and saw the sunset from terrace farms. Countless memories and infinite peace.\n\nI am planning to visit another village  in Uttarakhand (Kaladhungi near Jim-Corbett National park) in last weekend of June.\n\nIf someone has similar vibes of mine and are open to explore the rural and offbeat locations, DM me. I have prepared the itinerary. I have contacts with the homestay there. So accomodations,food and guide is also sorted.\n\nWe will be having a small trek to waterfall and take a jeep safari to National park apart from enjoying some local cultural activities this time.\n\nDM me if you are interested. Even if you can\u2019t make it this time but belong to this club, let\u2019s stay in touch.",

What's the most effective way to do just that? \n\nI've searched on google, but I can only find expensive packages that include many other activities too but I don't necessarily need those, I am going for one and only one purpose and I want to fulfill it in the most effective way possible. \n\nI have checked out the light pollution map and found that the highway connection Jaisalmer to a village ramgarh is pretty dark and free of light pollution. Maybe if I can rent some bike/car and move towards ramgarh during the night, I can catch a beautiful sky. It's a one hour drive (around 70KM). \nDo you think this plan is safe? what precautions i should take? I don't even know if that road is working ( I just hoped on maps and saw a road joining Jaisalmer and ramgarh with low light pollution levels). \n\n Or are any there any better options that are not necessarily very expensive, please mention them. I don't mind joining a safari that can take me to a good dark star gazing spot. But i literally don't know anything about that place.\n\nHelp me out if you guys have some experience with this.",

Delhi Mumbai Expressway Speed Limit 100, and one idiot in Santro driving 30 Kmph with one hand against ear with mobile phone in the right most fast lane. No reaction to horn or whatever. \n\n2. Overtook that Santro idiot after waiting for a lotta cars to pass in order to change to middle lane. Couple Kms ahead, an imbecile in Safari rolled his window couple inches and tossed an empty can from the top of the window, (not the bottom end of the window but top ; gosh) on the neat and clean expressway at a speed of 90. Missed my windshield by inches. \n\n3. Lots of idiots don't check the road before merging on it. They feel it's their right to merge and the people travelling at 80kmph on the road will brake to 0 for them. Nearly missed a lotta vehicles. Even in city people don't look back, they just merge.\n\n4. High beam menace, people just don't know when to turn it off. I keep on signalling to turn it off but they continue to keep driving at high beam. \nSome idiots are driving on the wrong side with the high beam on. God have mercy some idiots are parked with the high beam on. \nOn top of that some have custom modified high lumen lights just to blind others and keep it all tome high.\n\n5. Some idiots are driving with hazards lights on.\n\n6. ROADS : Roads here sucks, some expressways are good with heavy tolls. But most roads lacks the strips, reflectors, signs and marks, speed breaker signs and indicators, and speed breakers are the worst design ever. \n\nJust ranting.",

Your friendly, emotionally bankrupt Punekar reporting live from the urban safari that is my daily commute.\n\nToday, I had the honor of encountering our city\u2019s most majestic species: **Pushpas on the road.**\n\nYou know them.\n\nTwo-wheeler riders with the phone wedged between their shoulder and ear.  \nOne hand on the accelerator, one hand on destiny, and a neck angle that would make chiropractors retire..\n\n**Flower. Not fire.**\n\nSaw two accidents today, the first accident starred a **Pushpa on a Bullet**\u2014no mirrors, no brain cells, and a neck angle that would impress yoga teachers. He was gliding along with his phone tucked flower-style, moving slower than a sugarcane tractor on paternity leave. Then a car behind him honked. That was it. Pushpa got triggered. \n\n**\u201cRukhega nai saala!\u201d**\n\nHe panicked, twisted the throttle like he was escaping the law of physics, and **bang!** Straight into the car in front. The impact was so poetic, even the potholes paused to watch.  \n  \nHe gets down, dusts himself off, and instead of apologizing, turns to the car behind him and yells:  \n**\u201cKai ghai aahe tujhi?!\u201d**\n\nSir WHAT?!?!?\u2026 YOU were on the phone. YOU crashed. But sure, let\u2019s blame the person who honked because you were holding a traffic conference call on a scooter and moving slower than a sugarcane tractor on strike. (Btw, is it just me or are we seeing a lot of tractors on the road, in the past couple of weeks?)\n\nThe second accident was at **Mundhwa Chowk,** which I call **the armpit of Pune.** The traffic is so humid and sticky, it feels like the city is trying to marinate you in your own sweat.\n\nHere, another Pushpa bloomed. Wrong-side overtaking, speed breaker as launchpad, phone still flower-style like he was hosting **Pushpa FM 101.1: Live from the ICU.**\n\nPhysics, like Pune Police, did not care.  \n  \nHe went airborne, landed mid-road, and two random guys helped him up. He casually brushed the dust off, restarted the bike, and rode away like this was his **daily cardio.** In Mundhwa, that\u2019s not an \u201caccident\u201d\u2014it\u2019s just **another petal on the asphalt.**\n\nI swear, Pune\u2019s roads have become **Pushpa Gardens**\u2014full of two-wheeler flowers blooming in chaos.  \n**Flower today. Bouquet at your funeral tomorrow.**",

Me and my wife wanted to celebrate that by traveling some place. So we are looking for suggestions where we could travel to from Pune while considering below things:\n\n1. We got a car and plan to travel via car only as it'll be more flexible,  easy and more manageable for my daughter and wife. So distance can't be more than 8-9hrs away.\n\n2. We don't want to have a party etc, just want a peaceful trip where 3 of us could relax amd enjoy this occasion.\n\n3. We are open to anything, temples, beaches, mountains(trekking is also fine), jungle safari, camping.\n\n4. Plan to keep it to a 2 day trip but can extend or shorten the trip if needed.\n\nAll suggestions are welcome. Thanks.",

Hey guys, this is a long story \ud83d\ude05 I\u2019m sharing all the details so you can see exactly what happened. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ve added a clear summary at the end\u2014at least read that part!\n\nOne day, while I was busy with my work, I suddenly received a call from an unknown number. When I answered, it turned out to be a friend (let his name be ABC). I had only spoken to him during my first year of college (now I am in 4th year). At first, the conversation was casual\u2014we exchanged the usual \u201chow are you\u201d and \u201cwhat are you doing\u201d type of small talk. But after a while, he suddenly told me that he was doing some kind of business. Out of curiosity, I asked what business, and he said it was something related to \u201cdigital distribution of luxury products.\u201d He added that if we could meet in person, he would explain everything in detail.\n\nA couple of days later, I called ABC back and agreed to meet. He told me to come to Bakelore bakery in Madhapur, high-class area of Hyderabad. When we met, the interaction felt strange right from the start. Instead of explaining his business directly, he began by \u201ctesting\u201d my so-called business mentality. He asked me questions like, \u201cWhat is the difference between a small businessman and a big businessman?\u201d I gave him my answers, which seemed to satisfy him. After this, he told me he would discuss with his \u201csenior business partners\u201d and let me know whether I was \u201celigible\u201d to join the business or not.\n\nAfter two or three days, ABC called me again. He told me that his \u201csenior partners\u201d had agreed that I could become part of the business. He also said that the seniors wanted to meet me personally to \u201ctest my mentality.\u201d A date and time were fixed, and he asked me to come to a PAUL nexity caf\u00e9 near Durgam Cheruvu.\n\nWhen I reached, ABC first told me to wait at a high-end coffee shop nearby. After a while, he called me to the actual location. I joined him there, and soon a woman\u2014introduced herself as a senior business partner\u2014came and spoke to me. She was polite, well-spoken, and used advanced English while asking me questions about my \u201cbusiness mentality.\u201d I gave my answers, and she acted as if she was impressed. But honestly, it felt a little staged, like she was pretending to be impressed just to win me over.\n\nAfter she left, another person\u2014this time a male senior partner\u2014came in. He also asked me a few questions, and we had around 10\u201315 minutes of casual conversation. Then, before leaving, he dropped the real bombshell: he said that joining this business required an investment of \u20b93.8 lakhs, and not even for the actual business, but purely for \u201clicensing.\u201d According to him, since this was about digital distribution of luxury products (international brands like Gucci, Louis Vuitton, etc.), international licensing was compulsory, and that\u2019s what the 3.8 lakhs would cover.\n\nDuring all this, the senior partners had also mentioned something even more concerning. They told me that after my initial meetings, there would be a mandatory six-hour session that I would have to attend. But here\u2019s the shocking part: they said I must come to that meeting with \u20b93.8 lakhs ready in my account.\n\nAnd not just any regular account\u2014they specifically told me not to keep it in a normal bank account. Instead, they insisted I deposit the money into something they called \u201cGlobal Niyo Bank.\u201d That immediately struck me as strange, because if this was a legitimate business, why would they want the money parked in some unfamiliar place rather than a trusted bank?\n\nAfter telling me about the \u20b93.8 lakhs, the senior partner added another detail\u2014that my friend ABC himself had already paid almost \u20b99 lakhs for this licensing and some kind of \u201cstakes.\u201d That statement shocked me a bit. Later, when I asked my friend ABC directly about it, he was visibly uncomfortable. At first, ABC hesitated, stopping mid-sentence and struggling to explain, but eventually ABC admitted that yes, he had paid \u20b99 lakhs into this so-called business.\n\nThat was the exact point when I started to feel real doubt. The way ABC spoke\u2014pausing, stuttering, avoiding eye contact\u2014felt very unnatural, almost like he was forced to stick to a script but couldn\u2019t deliver it smoothly. Something about the whole situation just didn\u2019t add up.\n\nAfter I came home, I kept thinking about everything. Despite my doubts, a part of me was still curious, so I decided I should understand the business fully before making any judgment. I called my friend ABC and told him that I wanted him to personally explain everything in detail, because the so-called senior partners hadn\u2019t actually given me a clear picture of how the business worked. He agreed, and we planned to meet\u00a0the\u00a0next\u00a0day.\n\nThe next day, we met at McDonald\u2019s near Cyber Towers in Hitech City. To my surprise, my friend ABC came to pick me up in his Tata Harrier car and was unusually polite. At McDonald\u2019s, we had lunch together, and again, to my surprise, he insisted on paying the entire bill himself.\n\nAfterwards, we moved to the nearby Starbucks, where ABC said he would explain everything to me in detail. But before he even started, something strange happened\u2014he suddenly took a photo of me without asking. When I questioned him, he casually said he wanted to send it to another friend who had asked if he was hanging out with his girlfriend. I told him to send it on \u201cview once\u201d mode, but he brushed it off, saying he forgot. I tried to let it go, but deep down I felt uneasy. Something about the whole thing didn\u2019t sit right with me.\n\nMy friend ABC also told me that in order to attend the mandatory six-hour meeting, I had to book a slot in advance. That\u2019s why he insisted on my Aadhar card and PAN card details\u2014according to him, it was \u201ccompulsory\u201d to confirm my spot for that 6 hours meeting. Feeling pressured, I reluctantly sent the details to him through WhatsApp so that my slot could be booked.\n\nThat night, after coming home, I explained the entire situation to my parents. My father, concerned and cautious, said he wanted to meet my friend and the so-called senior partners to understand the business himself. I called my friend ABC and told him this. Shortly after, my friend ABC called back and scheduled a date and time for my father to meet the senior partners.\n\nTo my surprise, the initial location was set at Tolichowki, which is only about 10 km from my place. But at the last moment, they changed the location to Miyapur, which is roughly 23 km away. Without much choice, my father and I had to ride our bike all the way there.\n\nWe finally reached a Starbucks in Miyapur, where my father met my friend ABC and the senior partners. During the meeting, my father asked them directly whether the business was genuine or a scam. The senior partners confidently assured him that it was completely legitimate and that every single transaction would be properly\u00a0recorded.\n\nAfter leaving Starbucks, I asked my father for his opinion. He told me that he suspected this was a scam. He explained that, based on his instincts and the way everything had been handled, he felt this could be a potential fraud. He advised me not to go forward with the business. He also said that if I really wanted to pursue it, I could, but he strongly believed\u00a0it\u00a0was\u00a0a\u00a0scam.\n\nAfter coming home and thinking a lot, I decided to call my friend ABC. I asked him to show proof of the 9 lakhs transaction, since the senior partners had claimed that he had already paid this amount. From that point on, my friend started acting very strangely. He repeatedly asked me whether I believed him or not\u2014over and over again\u2014and gave me excuses like he had to leave for his village at 5 a.m. the next morning.\n\nDespite all this drama, I started noticing inconsistencies. That night, I stayed awake until 2 a.m., but to my surprise, my friend was online on WhatsApp until 2 a.m., even though he claimed he needed to leave at 5 a.m. This behavior made me increasingly suspicious.\n\nThen came the final confirmation: when I asked for the transaction proof, he set another condition\u2014he said I had to show \u20b93.8 lakhs in my own account first, only then would he show his bank statement. At that moment, everything clicked. The pressure tactics, the excuses, the personal data request, and now this ridiculous demand confirmed 100% that this\u00a0was\u00a0a\u00a0scam.\n\nThe next morning, I called my friend ABC and told him straight up that I was not interested and was dropping out of this so-called business. He tried his best to convince me, but I had already understood that this was a scam. I was firm and told him directly that I was not going forward, then cut the call.\n\nA little while later, he called again, trying to convince me once more. That completely broke my patience. I lost my cool and started giving him all kinds of bad words in Telugu, Hindi. Being from the Old City of Hyderabad, I didn\u2019t hold back and let him have it with full Hyderabadi style swearing. Finally, I cut the phone on his face, and that was the last interaction\u00a0I\u00a0had\u00a0with\u00a0him.\n\nEven after that, he kept calling me again and again, trying to convince me. But I didn\u2019t lift the phone. He even tried to massage me through WhatsApp which i didn't even open and ignored it. I completely cut off all contact, making it clear that I was done with this\u00a0scam\u00a0for\u00a0good. \n\nEven after all this, a small part of me still wondered if maybe, just maybe, this could be a genuine business. But that thought completely vanished when another close friend (let his name be Bahubali) messaged me on Instagram. Bahubali told me that the same \u201cfriend ABC\u201d had called him from an unknown number, the location on true caller was Maharashtra, claiming he was doing some kind of business and then Bahubali also told me that ABC tried to collect his family details from him. That was the final piece of evidence I needed\u2014it confirmed 100% that this was a huge scam. I immediately explained everything to bahubali, from start to finish, and made sure he didn\u2019t fall into\u00a0the\u00a0same\u00a0trap.\n\nSUMMARY:\n\n**1. Unexpected Call:**  \nI got a call from an old college friend (ABC) claiming he was doing a business in \u201cdigital distribution of luxury products\u201d and wanted to explain it in person.\n\n**2. First Meeting \u2013 Business Test:**  \nWe met at a caf\u00e9 in Madhapur. Instead of explaining the business, he \u201ctested\u201d my business mentality with questions. He said he would check with his \u201csenior partners\u201d to see if I was eligible to join.\n\n**3. Meeting Senior Partners \u2013 Polished Act:**  \nAfter a few days, ABC arranged a meeting with \u201csenior partners\u201d at a high-end caf\u00e9. A female partner spoke politely, acting impressed, followed by a male partner. Everything felt staged.\n\n**4. Big Money Claim:**  \nThe male partner said joining the business required \u20b93.8 lakhs for licensing. They claimed ABC had already paid \u20b99 lakhs. They insisted on using an unfamiliar \u201cGlobal Niyo Bank\u201d instead of a normal bank account.\n\n**5. Suspicion Arises:**  \nWhen I asked ABC about the \u20b99 lakh payment, he hesitated, stuttered, and avoided eye contact. This made me suspicious.\n\n**6. Attempt to Clarify:**  \nI met ABC again at McDonald\u2019s and Starbucks, where he explained the business and even took a photo of me without permission. He also demanded my Aadhar and PAN cards to \u201cbook a slot\u201d for a mandatory six-hour meeting.\n\n**7. Parental Advice:**  \nI told my parents. My father met the senior partners in Starbucks, Miyapur. The partners assured him it was genuine, but my father suspected a scam and advised me not to proceed.\n\n**8. Request for Proof:**  \nI asked ABC to show proof of the \u20b99 lakh transaction. He avoided answering, repeatedly asking if I trusted him, and claimed I needed to show \u20b93.8 lakhs in my account first.\n\n**9. Confirmation of Scam:**  \nABC\u2019s evasive behavior, pressure tactics, personal data requests, and unusual bank instructions confirmed it was a scam.\n\n**10. Cutting Contact:**  \nI refused to proceed, cut off ABC after he repeatedly tried to convince me, and verbally expressed my anger in Telugu/Hindi in Hyderabadi style.\n\n**11. Repeated Harassment:**  \nHe kept calling and messaging, but I ignored him completely, cutting off all contact.\n\n**12. Final Confirmation:**  \nAnother close friend (Bahubali) told me ABC had called him through an unknown number from Maharashtra asking about business and family details. This confirmed 100% that ABC was running a scam. I warned Bahubali about it.\n\n**13. Red Flags:**\n\n* Huge upfront payments for unclear licensing\n* Staged meetings with polished partners\n* Pressure tactics and repeated \u201ctests\u201d\n* Requests for sensitive personal documents\n* Unusual banking instructions\n* Evasive answers when asked for proof\n\n**Lesson:**  \nTrust your instincts. Even friends can involve you in scams. Verify everything before sending money or personal details.\n\nPLEASE UPVOTE THIS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE AND BEWARE OF SUCH SCAMS !!!!!\n\nThank you for reading. I truly appreciate you patience and I'd advice you all to beware of these scams.",

There is a pilot escort vehicle and the tailing escort vehicle making a way for 2 black Mercedes benz C250s. 4 cars in total.\n\nI thought it was police as they have beacon lights and siren but not. Interestingly the last car had someone dressed in police uniform but he was sleeping with mouth wide open.\n\nEvery vehicle has a license plate which ends with 0393.\n\nThe last vehicle was a safari with number plate AP 9 G 0393 and when I look it online it is CBNs vehicle but a black scorpio instead of a beige safari what I have seen.\n\nThe benz cars had the plates\n\nTS 11 FC 0393\nTS 11 ED 0393\n\nBut looks like these are all fake plates.\n\nThis motorcade sped towards Begumpet airport. Trying to figure out who it was.\n\nEdit: It could be CBN and I found many different vehicles tagged with this license plate with this safari being one of them. Looks like politician cars are not available on vahan website. It either shows a wrong vehicle or says not registered.",

They spoke Bengali, but it was clearly not their first language.\n\nNow, these guys, self-proclaimed car experts (because they drive a Creta and a Harrier, obviously), confidently advised us:\n\n\u201cBhai, always go for international brands like BOSHEEE (Bose). Harman is an Indian brand.\u201d\n\nMy friend and I exchanged looks of pure confusion. Seeing our doubt, they doubled down:\n\n\u201cThink of it this way\u2014Harman Baweja is an Indian name, right? So Harman must be an Indian brand!\u201d\n\nAt this point, I couldn\u2019t resist. I calmly explained that Bose is indeed an American company, but its founder, Amar Bose, was of Indian origin\u2014and Bengali at that! His father Noni Gopal Bose was even a freedom fighter.\n\nAs expected, they immediately refuted it. So, I just told them to Google it in their shiny iPhones .The moment their smug expressions turned into pure shock and mild disgust was absolutely priceless.\n\nThey left the shop with much disgust .\n\nBtw we choose the Indian brand \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a",

        "content": "Guide to Wheel Repair, OEM Wheel Purchasing and Wheel Fitment. I've been seeing a lot of damaged wheel stuff on /r/Justrolledintotheshop. With the bad weather coming decided to type up this guide that I hope can be helpful to some of you guys.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Wheel repair**:\n\nCost depends on your area and shop of choice. It can range from $100-200, generally. So what\u2019s not repairable? Cracked spokes, chunks missing from the wheel, cracks on the face of the wheel, cracks/holes in the middle of the barrel and driving on a wheel. Some places may claim they can fix this stuff and they may actually do it, but in all honesty it\u2019s just not that safe and bigger more reputable places will refuse the work. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nNon repairable examples:\n\n[Customer rim](http://imgur.com/bt6oFGk)\n\n[Customer Rim](http://imgur.com/jeSLoQe)\n\n[source legacygt.com forums](http://imgur.com/Xt9cgXV )\n\n[This is not repairable because the wheel bent so much it caused the crack in the face - customer\u2019s rim](http://imgur.com/40ALiVZ)\n\n[Don\u2019t even think about it](http://imgur.com/HPDVFD1)\n\n[This is a wheel that was driven on after the tire blew out](http://imgur.com/pZ5Sq8k). Most of the time these are not repairable because the lips of the rim get flattened while riding on it. Now if you only went a few feet or so then it can probably be repaired, but I\u2019ve seen wheels that looks like the owner drove for miles on it.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nChrome clad wheels are not repairable. Some common examples of cars that come with chrome clads are Chrysler 300\u2019s, Ford Edges, Cadillac Escalades, PT Cruisers and others. If you feel behind the spoke you\u2019ll be able to feel that it\u2019s a plastic piece on top of it.  These are not repairable because the plastic piece itself isn\u2019t repairable and you cannot buy that separately. If you need a replacement for one of these you\u2019ll either need to buy a used one, a replica or new from the dealer. Some of the chrome clads don\u2019t even have replicas made for them or the replicas were discontinued. \n\n[A chrome clad from a Chrysler Pacifica](http://imgur.com/yAjU0Ju)\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWheels can also be deemed too thin to repair. This happens when the wheel has had previous repairs and there\u2019s not enough metal to cut into again. Some wheels, though rare, can only be repaired once or twice because of the thickness from the factory. There\u2019s an Audi Q7 wheel like this. There are also wheels that have machined faces, which can only be cut a certain amount of times before it starts eating into the windows of the rim (aka the area in between the spokes or machined area). If you don\u2019t mind going with a full color wheel then these can be repaired by choosing a custom color to powdercoat it in or having it painted all silver.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo what is repairable then? Well you can repair curb rash, scratches, certain gouging if it\u2019s not too deep, bends on the front or back and cracks on the back lip that do not go through the tire bead.\n\n[Easy curb rash repair](http://imgur.com/7JJgLFV)\n\n\nRepairing cracked wheels gets a bad rep because some places just do a shit job. I cracked one of my forged wheels 6 years ago and had it repaired. I\u2019ve been driving on it ever since, both on the street and track. Examples of bad repairs:\n\nhttp://imgur.com/vynwAaQ\n\nhttp://imgur.com/IUqzRcY\n\n&nbsp;\n\n[When done right something like this is easily repairable](http://imgur.com/qurhbpJ) and will last. Now if you have multiple cracks, then you\u2019ll most likely need a replacement. Will update with a cracked wheel that was repaired appropriately. \n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nHub Bends  \nHub bends are when the center of the wheel, the hub area is bent sort of causing the whole wheel to twist. Some places will repair minor hub bends, others won\u2019t. It comes down to if it\u2019s cost effective or not for the shop because of the amount of time it takes to do.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n------------\n**Wheel Purchasing**\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nNext up, getting the part number. For this we\u2019ll be using www.transwheel.com  This site\u2019s design and operation may suck, but it is the best source for this particular info. You must put the www in front or the site won\u2019t work. They finally just updated to work on the latest IE and Safari. Other browsers I don\u2019t know.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nNow you\u2019ll want to click [Login as Our Guest](http://imgur.com/fZNgKLq) (retail)\n\n&nbsp;\n\nHere you put in your vehicles information, wheel size and spoke design. This is a third party company inputting all of the info so some of the info may be slightly off. For example you might have a 2008 BMW 325ci and when you put that info in the correct size doesn\u2019t come up. In these situations the boxes as all years, put bmw, model would be all models then I would add in  size and the amount of spokes and look at the pictures to match it up. They sometimes get info like the lug pattern wrong or for some reason they\u2019ll round or put it in inches. Almost all Honda/Acura 5 lug wheels are 5x114.3. Transwheel will sometimes round up to 5x115 or list it as 5x4.5. Its best if you know your car appropriately to recognize discrepancies and know you\u2019re looking at the right item.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAlright lets say I have a 2005 Acura TL and need a new 17in rim that has 5 spokes. [I put in my info and hit search](http://imgur.com/kjd6YXp).  Two wheels come up that look the same, but there\u2019s a note saying the valve stem area is different. So lets pull up the pictures. Click on one and it will load more info about the wheel, [then you can click the picture](http://imgur.com/NVg00lG) to see a bigger image along with OEM part numbers. Alright so I determine the top one is the one I have with the smaller valve area. [Now the number I\u2019m going to want to use is the ALY number, in this case its 71733](http://imgur.com/QWcQfgl) which is its Hollander number. With some wheels you\u2019ll see multiple numbers listed under the Hollander column, the one that has the ALY number is the main number used by all places, while the others are alternate numbers that were mostly used when the wheel was first released and a main number wasn\u2019t set yet.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n[Now I'll go to ebay and search rim 71733](http://imgur.com/jM4DJRx). Most wheels will be refurbished Certain wheels have replica versions, this being one of them. The titles of the Replicas normally will say new replacement. When you read the descriptions it should specify if it\u2019s OEM refurbished, OEM new, OEM used or a Replica. The replicas all tend to be made in China and will be cheaper than the OEM counterparts. If you need to save a few bucks this is a cost effective way.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAs most things sold on ebay there are good sellers and bad sellers. Here\u2019s a list of some of the companies I deal with on a daily basis and would recommend. \n\n* AAAA Hubcap Heaven\n* Blackburn\u2019s Wheels\n* Detroit Wheel and Tire\n* Factory Wheel Warehouse\n* Midwest Wheel and Tire\n* The Wheelership\n* The Wheel Gallery\n* World of Wheels\n\nRemember there are plenty of others. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nNot sure of the correct info on your wheel? Take the wheel off the car on the back side of the spokes you\u2019ll be able to find all relevant info such as width, diameter, offset and part number. The offset will generally say ET or IS followed by the number. Some wheels will have the info on the face of the wheel under the center cap if its a cap that covers the lugs, and others may have it on the back of the hub rather than the spokes. Certain wheel styles have different variations of width and offset depending on the car, so just make sure you get the appropriate one. Also be aware that if you drive a RWD car, the sizing is probably staggered with the rear widths being bigger than the fronts.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSidenote: eBay\u2019s compatibly chart does NOT work for OEM wheels. If you\u2019re still unsure if you\u2019re looking at the right wheel you can always ask the seller and they should be able to help.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n---\n**Wheel Fitment**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nNow for wheel fitment. The places you\u2019re going to find, deal with OEM wheels and will not be able to help too much if you want to do cross platform wheels, say Mercedes wheels on an Audi. This is were you\u2019re going to have to do the leg work as so many variables come into play for wheel fitment such as ride height, camber settings, wheel width, wheel diameter, wheel offset, lug pattern, center bore, caliper clearance and spoke design. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nThis offset calculator is a great place http://www.1010tires.com/Tools/Wheel-Offset-Calculator to see how adjustments in width and offset will effect the positioning of the wheel. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo an example. I drive a 2004 Audi s4. The lug pattern is 5x112 which is also used by Mercedes. I know I want a 19in rim so I go to www.transwheel.com [put in this info and hit search](http://imgur.com/GnmTWli). Alright 201 possible wheels. Let me just change how many I can see at a time and scroll through. [Where it says page size, if I change that to 201 and hit change it\u2019ll show me everything. So just match whatever you\u2019re looking at to that and you can see everything](http://imgur.com/vD0VzUz).\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIf I click into any rim I can see what car it came from.If I want pricing on items I\u2019ll use that aly number on ebay. This is where you\u2019ll have to do your own research on fitment. Sure I can use numerous Mercedes wheels, but I\u2019ll probably need hubrings because of the different hub sizes and possibly different lug bolts as older Mercedes had different size lug bolts than Audis. I can compare widths and offsets to what I have and figure out what will be the perfect fitment that I want. Sometimes offsets will not be listed but googling or check out auction descriptions will sometimes give that info. Also again be aware of discrepancies. In this Audi example I found a set of Land Rovers I was interested in that could be had for extremely cheap. I soon realized it was the only Land Rover listed and after some googling found that transwheel had the wrong lug pattern listed for that specific wheel. And because most wheel companies pull their info from transwheel, they too all had the wrong info on their ebay listings.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWell I hope this helps some of you this winter season and **feel free to ask any questions** you may have.",

        "content": "Lifetime review: 1993 Toyota T100 SR5. I have completed my 25 year evaluation of the [1993 Toyota T100 SR5 4WD MT](http://imgur.com/a/dBO211e).  I began my observations in 1993 at the age of three when my dad bought the new truck from a dealership on Broadway in Nashville.  For the first twelve years I paid close attention to passenger comfort, passenger safety, and kid-appeal alongside several other cars.  In 2005, I obtained my learner permit for the purpose of rating the pickup for drivability, utility, and reliability.  My evaluation finished on Wednesday after recording the results of the vehicle's overall safety.\n\nFor the most part, the truck remained in its stock form with the notable exceptions of a four-inch suspension lift, three-inch body lift, 12.5x35 tires, and Line-X bed liner.  It sported various combinations of tool boxes, bed enclosures, and brush guards depending on its use.  Usage ranged from every-day-commuter to workhorse to show truck.  Driving conditions included temperatures between -30 and 115 degrees Fahrenheit, medium off-road, deep snow, snowy and icy hills, mild flooding, and extreme low visibility.\n\nI'll begin my review with some ratings for general catagories that I think are important, and then I'll expand on those ratings below.\n\n* Comfort: 5/10\n\n* Drivability: 3/10\n\n* Reliability: 10/10\n\n* Utility: 7/10\n\n* Appearance: 7/10\n\n* Safety: 6/10\n\n\n\n# Comfort: 5/10\n\nThe regular cab has a single row of seats that are something between bench and bucket seats.  The driver seat adjusts forward and backward with the center console/armrest that folds up to reveal a center \"seat\".  The passenger seat adjusts independently, and both sides are capable of seatback tilt adjustments that are limited by the rear bulkhead.  Legroom is average or slightly small, and a small passenger could recline comfortably by sacrificing a small amount of leg room.  The center seat position is almost unusable because of interference between an occupant's legs and the floor-mounted shifter, but it works in a pinch.\n\nHeadroom is plentiful, and visibility is excellent.  All four roof pillars are narrow, and blind spots are easy to check.  Side windows are large and extend back well beyond the occupants' heads.  The center of the rear window slides open for improved airflow.\n\nThe lack of a real bench seat means that laying down is possible but not really comfortable.  Attempting to fit two people horizontally quickly becomes akward.  The seat material is slightly firm, and extended road trips may require frequent rest stops.\n\nThe steering wheel is tilt-adjustable, but when I move it to its highest position, my hands frequently hit the windshield.  The instrument cluster is difficult to see near twilight but otherwise well designed.\n\n\n\n# Drivability 3/10\n\nMy only experience driving the T100 was after it had been lifted, so this may not be the most accurate assessment.  The tall tires left the truck with a verry vague sense of steering, and the \"heavy-duty\" shocks are too week to handle the extra leaf springs that were used to lift the rear end.  It takes several seconds for the truck to recover from even mild bumps, and the stiff springs make the ride very harsh unless loaded down.\n\nThe relatively long suspension and soft tires handles large bumps far better than expected, but tire roll and vehicle rollover are very real concerns.  Excellent visibility makes low-speed maneuvers easy to judge, but the long wheelbase and four-wheel-drive severely limit the turning radius.\n\nThe three-liter V6 is extremely underpowered for the heavy chasis and tall wheels, but the transfer case has a crawler gear for extreme torque needs.  The part-time 4WD system contains two open differentials and no center differential.  Forward grip is lacking, and slippery surface take-offs require a delicate right foot.\n\nThe transmission is fairly clunky, but it provides good feedback.  Clutch engagement is very tricky.  This is a very difficult transmission for a new driver.  The ABS is acceptable quality and useful when the bed is unloaded.\n\n\n\n# Reliability: 10/10\n\nHoly crap!  I'll never give another car a 10/10 for reliability after seeing what's possible!  This truck has been abused since the early years, and the only major problem was a head gasket failure that was covered under the factory waranty.  It's been in several crashes, but repairs have always been limited to body panels and one condensor.  The air conditioner still blows cold, and the heater will cook you alive.\n\nHowever it did develop a few problems after a head-on collision with an Interstate dividing wall last year.  Following that collision, the driver window sometimes sticks closed (never sticks open), and the cruise control no longer works.  I didn't get a chance to fix these issues before the end of my test.\n\nOther problems are as follows:  The clutch pedal bracket snapped from rust at about 200k miles and had to be replaced by the updated version.  The speedometer failed around 220k miles requiring the replacement of the instument cluster (including the odometer).  ...  ... Actually that's it.\n\n# Utility: 7/10\n\nDat 8 foot bed doe!\n\nThis is a pickup truck; it hauls stuff.  With the upgraded suspension, I had no problems hauling a half pallet of sod.  The bed is a little high, but I can still get my four wheeler in with some ramps.  With only 2.4 seats, you can't carry a family, but it's great for a single dad with a construction job or a high-school boy.\n\nMy favorite addition was a foldable canvas bed topper.  My dad got one from a company called Safari Tops back in '94, and it did a great job protecting cargo from wind and rain.\n\nWith the weak powertrain, towing capacity is pretty limited, but I use it to haul a small trailer sometimes.\n\n\n\n# Appearance: 7/10\n\nIn stock form, it looks pretty ordinary.  It came with a dark green color that didn't really stick out, but I repainted it with BMW Midnight Black.  It usually had some sort of stainless steel bull-nose brush guard on the front, but that took most of the force of the Interstate divider crash that killed the cruise control.\n\nAfter the crash, I decided to go all black.  I replaced the old polished aluminum wheels with some simple seventeen-inch wheels, and I put some new black canvas on the topper.  Everyone likes the way it looks.  It doesn't really stand out, but I get compliments whenever people see me by it.\n\nKids like it.  Bros like it.  Women like it.\n\nHowever, it does not *sound* great.  The horn sounds like the roadrunner, and the engine is forgetable.\n\n\n\n# Safety: 6/10\n\nThis truck has seen several crashes.  Most of them were not severe, but I feel like the only real safety feature is its weight.  It does not have airbags, and the frame is remarkably stiff.\n\nThe first crash happened in '98 on an icy winter morning on our way to school.  It was pretty simple; while taking a turn at an intersection going downhill, all the tires lost grip.  I hesitate to call this a crash because we stopped with the front passenger wheel hanging far enough over a ditch to tip the whole truck in.  There were no real injuries, just some painful shuffling to get out of the truck sideways.  Most crashes ended up like this including a failed attempt to tow a lawn mower out of a ditch.\n\nThe next most severe crash was that Interstate wall I keep mentioning.  I was merging onto the highway when I hit a small snow bank made by a plow.  The front end got kicked into the four-lane road.  I tried to counter steer and accelerate in 4WD, but that didn't do anything.  I slammed on the brakes and watched the wall fly at me.  I was going between 10 and 15 mph when I hit.  The brush guard took most of the force, but I was a little sore the next day and had bruised knees.\n\nThe incident that finally killed the T100 happed last Friday while I was hauling some furniture to my new house with my friend David.  We were driving through an intersection in the rain when a Versa took a left turn from the oncoming lane.  When I first hit the brakes, we were going about 40 mph. The collision deflected us into the traffic light pole.  I hit my knees on the dash, scraped my elbow on the door, and bit my lip.  The seatbelt hurt more than anything.  David was the real victim; something about the multiple impacts from the car, pole, and couch hurt his back.  He's rapidly improving, but I'm not impressed with the way the cab got squished.\n\n\n\n# Conclusion: 8/10\n\nWould buy again.  I want to sit here for the next few hours and type out all the stories and memories that went with that truck, but I'll save that for a rainy day.  There's just something special about that one vehicle that you can always count on, especially when it's your first car.  When you've been with a car for 25 years, you develop a bond with it that can't be replaced.\n\nThere are memories from all stages of my life that didn't happen in another car.  This truck will never leave me.",

        "content": "I wish Porsche would offer a 911 safari car from the factory.. I want to start by saying that I am sure that Porsche has a whole team of much smarter people then I am, of market researchers who have already looked over this idea. I am sure they have decided there is not a big enough market to make the time and investment worthwhile. Please suspend some disbelief and give me a chance to explain why I think this is a good idea. \n\nI wish and think that Porsche should offer 911 safari spec cars from the factory. Porsche and the 911 has a rich racing history that Porsche loves to capitalize on to sell cars. The 911 Turbo and GT cars are a small part of Porsche's overall sales, but they help drive the sales of their \"lower\" models. \n\nPeople who buy 911s aren't just purchasing a supercar they can use every day, they buy into Porsche's history. But Porsche doesn't capitalize on their rally racing history even though it's just as vibrant as their circuit racing history. \n\nI think they should offer a 911 safari spec car, and there are several reasons why. As Doug has pointed out in some of his videos since the Ford Raptor entered the market, off-roading in all forms has been a considerable market. The Ford Bronco took over the internet on its release date. There is so much hype over the new land rover defender too. The Jeep Wrangle regularly makes big sales numbers and has a significant following. Have you seen the resale value on used Wranglers?\n\nDo I think that a 911 safari spec car will sell anywhere near a Jeep? No, of course not, but I believe there is a market for a 911 rally car. I think there are people out there that look at these large offroader SUVs and think, \"what if I could have an offroader sports car.\" Thus the 911 safari. There is an augment that one could buy an STI and have a rally car. But if we are real with ourselves, it still needs aftermarket work to be off-road capable. People might also want to spend more than 35K+ plus off-roading parts on their car.\n\nPorsche should offer the safari in limited numbers, such as their GT cars. Leh Keen said, \"So total budget for the customer should be about $120,000.\" I am sure people would pay much more for a factory spec car with a warranty. The knowledge that Porsche engineers worked on this car would carry all the weight Porsche would ever need to sell these cars. \n\nIn true Porche, fashion have an option list a mile long. Want the optional 5\" lift kit, no problem we have that. Want color match rally lights on the roof, we got you fam. Want RWD with big trail tires and gold rims? Just check the box and give us your money. \n\nI genuinely think there is an off-road 911 market for a factory car with a warranty. I personally would love to see Porsche embarrass this market and show us that the everyday supercar can also be just a super offroad.",

        "content": "1975 RHD Series III 109 Land Rover. I'm posting this note looking for some advice regarding my Rover. Here is the story in a nut shell: I purchased this truck in South Africa while posted there (State Dept.). It is a South Africa Army \"surplus\"/game park vehicle. It is a 109 with the safari top and has a 2.6 engine in it. It is all original. Body wise it is sound but needs paint. Mechanically I've had all the underpinnings (suspension, brakes, diffs) reconditioned or replaced and works well. It is titled and tagged here in VA (long story about that process). My problem is the drive train. While it runs ok the engine is in need of a rework and parts may be an issue. I would like to keep it as original as possible but at the same time currently it just sits in the garage looking lonely because it is not road trip ready. I need to fix it so I can drive it or sell it but I'm not sure what it is even worth. Any suggestions are appreciated.\nhttp://www.ezimba.com/work/140922C/ezimba18089518861200.jpg\n\nhttp://www.ezimba.com/work/140922C/ezimba18089584953800.jpg\n\nhttp://www.ezimba.com/work/140922C/ezimba18089532962800.jpg\n\nhttp://www.ezimba.com/work/140922C/ezimba18089565567500.jpg",

Sorry if this has been answered, but searching didn't yield much. \nI am moving from CO to CA and want to ship my project truck (1985 FJ60) out to my new home. It runs, but int really the type of truck you wanna drive more that 200 miles at once. I contacted a few shippers and they all want ~1400 to get my truck to me. For only 1200 miles that seems sort of steep. Also, I am nervous a driver will show up with a car carrier and between the 5 inch lift, 35\" tires, and full safari rack the truck wont fit. Any other ideas? I am not opposed to renting a truck and trailer but most rental places dont rent pickups bigger than half ton. \n\nThanks\nTM",

It runs ok but could be alot better so i want to restore it. The problem is that i know little about cars. So i was wondering if its possible to restore and replace moat of the parts in the car with modern ones (if thats even possible) so that i wont have to keep finding old parts for it and having to keep fixing the old and broken parts. And i want to know how much that would cost approximately. Also whats the best website to learn how to fix cars and restore them.",

        "content": "Time to bring back the AMC Eagle.. Edit: Some of you seem to think I\u2019m advocating getting rid of the Wrangler. Incorrect. I\u2019m talking about another vehicle in the Jeep showroom to appeal to a different demographic. \n\nWranglers are miserable road trip vehicles but their 4wd system is awesome- particularly in bad weather. Jeep has great brand equity and a long history of repurposing stuff to stay relevant. Witness: the new Gladiator. \n\nSo here\u2019s what I\u2019m proposing: a Wrangler that sits a little lower, is a little more freeway friendly, a bunch more aerodynamic, and (maybe) has three row seating. You know- a 1987 AMC Eagle. \n\nWhat I\u2019m imagining is the current Wrangler. Push the body out over the current fender flares and the current frame rails/metal bumpers. This will provide more interior room and a little tumblehome without increasing actual footprint. Pushing it forward 4-6 inches also allows more slope to the windshield for better aero. Drop the entire thing 2-3 inches and chop an inch out of the roof to make it visually shorter without sacrificing headroom. Keep the classic Wrangler tail lights but style the front like a GC with round headlights. Keep the running gear as-is, very minor tweaks to shocks/springs. Minor (if any) changes to electronics/switchgear/etc. As much as possible should be a direct carry over from the Wrangler to keep costs low and push its Jeep heritage. \n\nThe whole goal here is to leverage brand equity and sunk R&D costs to build a Subaru Outback competitor without needing to develop a new platform. \n\nCall it a Jeepster or Commando or Safari and build it on the Wrangler chassis so it falls under truck EPA regulations.\n\nCons: Jeep build quality and sophistication. Poor fuel economy. Truck(ish) ride and handling. \n\nPros: It\u2019s a Jeep for soccer moms who don\u2019t like the Wranglers fuel economy and lift over height. It has to meet truck EPA standards, not car. Other than body design and crash testing most components are already designed and tested.",

I attempted to replace my factory stereo yesterday (part of which involved having the keys in ignition and shifting to D1 to make room to remove the bezel) and upon replacing everything the keys are stuck in the ignition and I can't get it out of park. \n\nThe connections that required removing for the stereo (besides itself + antennae) were the rear AC, rear wipers, and headlights. The driveway is about a 5% gradient (if I math'd correctly: 1.25\" rise over 21.5\" run) I read somewhere perhaps push the car forward to take the strain off the brake and then try shifting, maybe I wasn't pushing hard enough, it was more like rocking but anyway.\n\nSo far I've tested:\n-rear brake lights still work\n-fuses under the hood appear all fine\n-dis/reconnected battery \n-grabbing the cylinder ears with pliers to find if there is play or a sweet spot\n\nThank you in advance!",

The Sport version has the same motor as the normal S, but it has a much stronger transmission.  It also needs the 300-mile battery pack due to the peak power required for the high acceleration.\n\n2. The water cooling on the battery is actually thermal regulation.  He said that l-ion batteries last MUCH longer if they are charged at a certain temperature.  When plugged into the wall, the wall voltage is used to warm or cool the battery to the appropriate temperature prior to charging.\n\n3. The charging system is designed in such a way that it can take ANY voltage, AC or DC. (there's a control box inside)\n\nDemo guy:\n\n4. The computer system is linux-based\n\n5. The browser is custom written but uses the webkit backend (like safari)\n\n6. There are app downloads, but they are approved by tesla.\n\n7. It has 2 usb ports in the front, and 2 in the back.\n\n8. It has a hard drive (he might have meant internal flash hard drive) that can store music (didn't ask size)\n\n9. It has a 3G connection and will serve as a Wi-Fi hotspot to car occupants.\n\n10. It can reverse tether to a phone and use the phone's internet connection if you don't have the 3G subscription or are not in a service area for the Tesla's band (don't know what freq it is)\n\n11. The handles are pop out and will pop out if you approach the car with the key fob or touch them (like those touch sensitive lamps or a touchscreen, assuming the car is unlocked)\n\nAlbum (lol blur): http://imgur.com/dohFz,3W4KP,SobQf,Xq9C8,Yodp5,joRms",

Good news for us, bad news for our driving situation.\n\nObviously, fitting four kids (all under 4 years old) into a 4.5 person vehicle isn't ideal for anything longer than a trip to the grocery store (and even that's pushing it).\n\nSo I'm looking at larger vehicles, while struggling with my mistrust of minivans. I'll spare you my (and my friends') tales of woe, but the long and short of it is that I don't really trust their drivetrain reliability, and have no use for the offset steering wheel column driving experience (/r/firstworldproblems calling!) that some models have (90s Caravans, 00's Toyota Sienna). \n\nAlso, I'm **comfortable spending $4,000, to $6,000.** I'm very handy in my own right so I'm not beholden to a stealership or shady mechanic. I also have a family connection to a shop with a lift and tools so if I get a project or handyman special I can get it fixed for cheap(er). \n\nWe have currently a later-model Impala (such vanilla-y goodness) and a Chevy Blazer (S-10 chassis, 4-door, 4WD). The Impala is good enough to keep around as we are the original owners, it's reliable thus far and it gets decent gas mileage. We live in Western NY so we get snow, but we are suburbanites and hard-core 4WD isn't *mandatory.*\n\nThe Blazer is going to have to get changed out for something else with a third row of seating. The unfortunate thing about a third seat is that pretty much rules out any modern station wagon (that I can think of).\n\n**Currently under consideration:**\n\n-    Astro/Safari (so far my favorite option)  \n-    Chevy Traverse, as the wife thinks the Astro is *too* van-like  \n-    Trailblazer EXT (apparently the EXT has a third row of seats)  \n-    Dodge Durango (~2004 vintage)   \n\nFord Explorers are not on the list because I had a coworker with one (a 2002, I think) and, to understate, they *hated* it. Let's just say I have been regaled with many tales of woe about that vehicle. Unless something major changed, I'm not particularly interested.\n\nFor styling, I'm fine with an Astro BUT the wife thinks it's too much like a van, and even called it a full-size van (my protestations be darned!) She wants something non-van-like, or at least not as van-y as an Astro.\n\nTo aid in my quest, I've paid for a year subscription to [Consumer Reports](http://www.consumerreports.org/) as I've always had a ton of respect for their ratings and reviews (back to the pre-internet days of inch-thick car rating books). I found an interesting [MT article](http://www.motortrend.com/roadtests/suvs/1105_three_row_crossover_suv_comparison/viewall.html) that turned me on to the Durango. I'm also happy to hear your personal anecdotes and experiences with any of the vehicles on the list or if you really want to recommend something I haven't mentioned.\n\nSo, is there anything I'm missing? I know I'm going to have to lay down my dreams of improved fuel economy. Is there such a thing as a bulletproof, cheap, minivan that I'm overlooking? A funky wagon with a third seat less than 15 years old (1995 Caprice/Roadmaster wagons are a *little* too old for my preference)? Should I take this question to a different sub? What say you?\n\nAlso, there are \"auction\" dealers around - are those something I should be looking at, or are they too much of a crapshoot?\n\n**TL;DR:** Looking for a reliable ride for a young family of five for (hopefully) under $6,000. There's lots of time before baby #3 arrives, so I can sit back a little and wait for A Really Great Deal if I have to.",

        "content": "Should I Be Shaving My Back Hair Because Someone Doesn't Like It? . **TLDR**; I have body hair, the person I'm talking to kind of implied that my back hair in particular was a deal breaker. I was going to get rid of it anyways, but I feel weird knowing that someone wouldn't want to be with me just because of that. Should I leave them or should I just suck it up and shave?   \n  \nI am a female, but I am from a background where the hairy genes are STRONG. I find myself harrier than my male friends or the guys I talk to. I have very prominent hair all over my body, which I think is normal, and I don't shave because I dress very conservatively and I feel uncomfortable wearing even short sleeves, let alone showing off my back. \n\nI've been talking to someone recently, and they are an extremely straightforward person, which I actually like. They noticed my back hair and pointed it out. Later on, they expressed to me that they did not like it as they didn't have that much themselves, and asked me if I was going to get it lasered in the future (respectfully, ofc, but it still shocked me a bit).\n\nThey started asking me about waxing as well, which honestly made me sad. They kind of implied that the back hair was a deal breaker to them, but didn't seem to mind the previous arm and slight stomach hair when they noticed it. \n\nI don't like my body hair, and I did plan to get it lasered or something in the future, or at least wax regularly, but I've always wanted someone who would accept me fully, body hair included. It makes me feel bad and insecure knowing that someone I like would like me a little less or maybe even leave me just because I have back hair. \n\nI keep thinking about circumstances where I can't get waxed or shaved often, or the fact that those things take up hours of my day when I decide to do it.\n\nMy dilemma is that I've always wanted someone who'd accept me fully, but I don't know if that matters cause I was planning on getting rid of it in the future anyways.  \n\n I don't know whether or not I should leave if they do think its a deal breaker (Im planning to ask), or if I should just suck it up and get rid of the hair because I was going to do it anyways.",

        "content": "My mom cheated on my dad two years ago and it still eats me alive. I feel like i should have moved on from this, but for some reason i still think about it at least once a week. For context, I (15F) found my mom cheating on my dad over two years ago. I was around 13 years old. I was setting up my new phone that i got early for my birthday when I saw my mom on safari, and the Tinder logo was right in the center of the screen. I watched over her shoulder a while longer and noticed her scroll through chats with other men. I felt sick to my stomach, i wanted to cry right then and there. I held my thoughts in and looked away, already calculating in my head. Later, my mom gave me her phone to call my grandmother. She went to another room, and as I was talking to my grandmother, i went through her search history and found Tinder in there multiple times. I clicked on the link and couldn\u2019t even scroll through any of the chats because it made me so sick even to look. I remember the top chat was from a guy named Richard. My mom and him were exchanging messages that my brain has blocked out, but his black and white profile picture of a lion is burned into the back of my mind.\n\nAbout a day later, i told my dad what i saw. I was breaking down as i said it, i could hardly get the words out. My dad comforted me, but i could tell he was just staying strong for me. We watched part of a movie before i told him I was going to bed. He wished me good night, but he didn\u2019t sleep in bed with my mother that night.\n\nThe next morning, i woke up to my mom in my room with a sad and frustrated expression on her face. she asked me why i had told my dad what i saw and why i didn\u2019t come to her first. I just said i didn\u2019t know i was supposed to tell her. She started to cry and told me that my dad had just been distant (busy with work) recently, that she needed love, and she wanted to feel beautiful again. I comforted her in the moment, but looking back, i can\u2019t tell if that was manipulation. I\u2019ve never been married, but cheating is never what it should come to.\n\nI went downstairs after a while, and everything was just.. normal? my dad was working on his computer seated at the kitchen table, my mom was doing laundry. i tried to apologize to my dad, thinking i had made a big deal over nothing. the world didn\u2019t end, they didn\u2019t get divorced, but i\u2019ve noticed my parents act differently. my dad always tries to please my mom but she\u2019s always annoyed or snappy when he has a question she thinks he should know the answer to or when something doesn\u2019t go how she wants it to. it\u2019s a tense environment around 70% of the time. i was talking with a friend about this a while back, but it just occurred to me to add this. my dinners and other events with just me and my family are dead silent 80% of the time, especially dinners. my friend said it was so weird and awkward how it was so silent while she was eating with us one time, but i\u2019ve never known it as weird, it\u2019s always happened in my household. Maybe it\u2019s always been a tense environment and i\u2019ve never noticed. My mom and dad are both teachers, my mom works with elementary kids while my dad works with college students. my dad works more than my mom, often working in the evening when he\u2019s home or late into the night. my mom works a bit less, but she\u2019s tired and stretched thin 24/7. Sometimes i wonder if they want to get divorced but can\u2019t because of financial reasons or they don\u2019t want to put stress on me.\n\nI\u2019m not being abused or anything; I\u2019m fed, my parents love me, but this has been eating at me for over two years. Even if this gets no comments or upvotes, it\u2019ll be good to get it off my chest. I've been thinking about this a lot more recently, and it's affecting my mood towards my mother. I'll be fine and happy at school, but around her, it's hard to look her in the face knowing what she did. How can I get this burden off my shoulders? Should I talk to them? Should I talk to my dad or my mom separately? It's been eating at me forever. I need advice.\n\nThanks to whoever decides to read this long thing, lol.",

        "content": "How do I explain to my son that my husband and I are okay with him being gay when we don\u2019t know for sure if he\u2019s accepted himself?. Link to 1st Update:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1mfuwr4/update_how_do_i_explain_to_my_son_that_my_husband/\n\nHello all. Just to be clear, my husband (50M) and I (47F) are not homophobic in any way, we\u2019re simply unsure of the correct away to approach our son about this.\n\nThis all started a year ago when my now 15 son had just turned 14. It was summertime and my son was enrolled in a lacrosse camp. One day he comes back from camp and tells me he met a boy from another team named Marcus (fake name). My husband and I are excited to hear that he\u2019s making friends. I suggest that he should invite Marcus over one day. My son seems happy to hear this and they start to hang out a lot over the summer. Now we\u2019re about a month into the summer and I\u2019m cleaning out my son\u2019s room while he\u2019s at camp and I noticed that his computer is open and unlocked on his desk. I try my best not to be a snoopy mother, but since it was just sitting there, I thought I might just take a look and make sure he\u2019s being safe. We had just recently given him some social apps, such as Pinterest, Instagram, and Snapchat. I just wanted to check to make sure he wasn\u2019t doing anything that could be possibly dangerous.\n\nThe first thing I see when I open up Safari is three tabs. One is to an article about a bunch of pride flags, one is to a quiz to determine your \u201cgaydar\u201d (still not sure what that is), and  the third is a YouTube video about some Youtubers journey coming out out of the closet. At first, I was pretty confused and unsure what this meant. I called my husband into the room and showed him the tabs. He just sighed and brushed it off. My husband then explained to me that he did the same thing when he was a boy. It seems that many teenagers will experiment around this age to try and figure out things about themselves. So both of us just brushed it off as normal teenage behavior.\n\nWell, next thing we know, Marcus and my son are hanging out almost every other day. If they\u2019re not hanging out together, they\u2019re texting or calling. I mentioned to my husband that I feel like our son and Marcus have grown very close in a short period of time. He agrees with me, but also notes that it\u2019s perfectly healthy and they\u2019re both good kids so we should give them time to hang out and have fun. I 100% agree with this, but I\u2019ve always been a bit protective of my son and I just want to make sure that he and Marcus aren\u2019t going to have a bad fallout that leaves him super upset.\n\nSo both of us are giving them space to hang out and have fun this summer. But I\u2019m making sure to keep a bit of an eye on them. The first time I noticed that my son and Marcus may be dating was when I came downstairs into our kitchen one night when they were having a sleepover to find them cuddling on the couch. Marcus had his head on my son\u2019s chest, and my son had his legs wrapped around Marcus\u2019s torso. This wasn\u2019t just some kind of position where It might\u2019ve looked like they were sitting close to each other. They were very obviously cuddling and even holding hands.\n\nI quietly return to my room and explain to my husband what I saw. My husband agreed with me and noticed that our son and Marcus had been getting very close lately. Neither of us were very surprised to find this as we kind of expected it. We decided to let it play out quietly and see if they would come to us first. We had no clue how long they had been hiding this relationship or if they were even officially dating yet.\n\nNow they are both 15 and it\u2019s been about a year since they met each other. They still haven\u2019t come to us to talk and I don\u2019t know Marcus\u2018s parents stance on this topic so I don\u2019t want to bring it up to them and potentially cause Marcus any trouble at home. Now my husband and I are pretty sure they\u2019re dating as we\u2019ve seen them cuddling multiple times and even caught them kissing once when they thought they weren\u2019t being watched. Neither my husband or I are opposed to our son being gay or to our son having a boyfriend/girlfriend, but I\u2019d really like him to come to us and tell us first. \n\nEven if I have to go to them and talk privately with Marcus and my son. I\u2019d rather do that sooner than later and have this conversation with them so they can understand we accept and love them. I also feel like we\u2019re introducing on their privacy and they would have more freedom and privacy if they could tell us. Any advice would help, thank you!",

Basically I went on my boyfriend\u2019s phone to shut off an alarm because we both have the day off. I then get on to safari for a reason I\u2019m not even sure and find a happy ending massage place that he had looked up and immediately my heart dropped. I then go into his maps obviously and find massage places but not the one he looked up. I then go into his deleted pictures to see if he made an appointment or I don\u2019t even know what I\u2019m looking for at this point. But I find a picture of a naked girl and text messages exchanging information for what looked like to be a sex worker (she asked if he was a cop and there was talk about money) but the messages stop after that. So I confront him about it and he says he didn\u2019t actually do anything but he did look into it bc he\u2019s \u201csick\u201d. Basically he said he does it not for the actual meeting up but just because he\u2019s curious. LISTEN I  KNOW. But I\u2019m having a really hard time deciding where to even start thinking about this. I immediately told him to get therapy if it\u2019s for everything he said and not just to cheat on his pregnant girlfriend. Which he has already started the process of. So do I try and work this out with him because I\u2019m pregnant and he didn\u2019t actually do anything. Or do I just move back in with my mom and say we can figure out co parenting. I\u2019m having a really hard time figuring out how bad this is and I also have a lengthy history of taking people back when I shouldn\u2019t. I\u2019m trying really hard to respect myself and do what I think is best for me and my baby. He does seem extremely remorseful and I truly never thought he would ever do something like that to me. Ughhh please help.",

        "content": "I\u2019m having urges to torture and kill animals and I\u2019m starting to want to do the same to humans.. Just wanted to start off by saying I\u2019m 13. So, I got my first iPod when I was in third grade. And I was watching a bunch of videos on YouTube/safari. I came across this one video of a man getting dragged into the woods and shot in the stomach and he got split into pieces. I was completely disgusted. A few years later probably around 5th grade I saw a video of someone getting raped. And I ended up liking it. From there on I liked pretty much liked the concept of rape. But I didn't know how to get rape porn so I just watched a lot of hardcore porn. Same with 6th grade. Now here comes 7th grade. I'm home school and I don't get ANY social interaction. All I do is sit down and play video games and watch YouTube. It's all I pretty much know and it's super comfortable. I always have good memories playing video games. I have been playing video games sense I was 2 years old and Ive loved them ever sense. And 7 months go by and I haven't talked to a single person. The last time I talked to someone was November 14 on his birthday party. But anyway I go and I hang out with friends. And they notice I'm super antisocial. They even start commenting on. I barely talked. I don\u2019t know if this matters but we went to 7/11 and bought an apple. Then we cut a hole to the middle and put the other side and put weed on the top and smoked. That was my first time.when I was hanging out with them. And everything I said was super awkward. (This was around 7 months ago)After that I remember finding another rape video. And I really like it. So I found more and more and more and more and more. Then I saw some videos that had a lot of blood in them. One was a video of a kid who was shot in the jaw with a sniper in Iraq and he was still alive. But he was doing a kind of screaming but whining thing because he couldn't talk. I also saw some other videos of people getting there head crushed by cars who people getting raped and murdered.i also saw a video of a baby getting run over by a train. And I once saw another video of a Mexican max getting all his limbs cut off. He was still alive until they cut his head off. I started liking all the stuff. Even the videos about torturing animals. In the end of 7th grade I got to the point where I would talk to myself. Now when people talk to themselves it's not like they see things. But they get there imagination mixed up with reality. Like I'll be thinking I'm in front of a crowd of people when in reality I'll be in my room alone and I'll start to think that's real life. And let's say someone in my head is talking to me I'll talk to them, but out loud because if I don\u2019t talk to them I\u2019ll think they\u2019ll get mad at me and I don\u2019t want to be rude. So there will be times I have my eyes open and I'll be talking to someone who isn't there. Another thing is that I'll be going to the bathroom and I'll be scared to go because I think I'll be in a public place when In reality I'm not. And I'll keep telling myself this and I know I'm not in a public place it's just something in my body tells me I am. In 7th grade my day consisted of playing video games for about 12 hours a day. One time I was at my cousins house and I saw they have some bunny\u2019s. I had the urge to hurt them. So I picked up the bunnys and I was throwing them and stuff and I was shaking there cage. I was shaking at that moment with adrenaline. I wanted to punch torture them and hear them suffer but I just know it's not the right thing.  And I'm totally enjoying it. But I can't help it. I'll also pace around the room playing with my fingers and twitching. Currently in 8th grade things have stayed the same. I have bunnies that roam around in my field and I just want to put them in a sock and hit them agents a tree. And then put them in water for a few seconds and drown them but not long enough to die. Then just keep doing that. Or pour gasoline on it then burn it. But I know I shouldn\u2019t do it. At school some people call me a tweaked because my eyes twitch. It\u2019s like I\u2019m in complete control over twitching my eyes.im just calling it twitching because i don\u2019t know what else to call it. My eyes only twitch without my complete control when I\u2019m tired. I told my mom and she said it\u2019s Normal. It just feels so satisfying every time I twitch my eye. I keeps me calm. And if I don\u2019t twitch my eye I feel like I have a lot of anxiety. For example: lay your arm flat and don\u2019t move it no matter what. But try to send a signal to your arm telling it to move but like I said just don\u2019t move it. You see what I mean? It gets really frustrating when you can\u2019t do it . If You don\u2019t believe me I can link you some of those videos of rape and people being murder for extra proof. And should I tell my parents? Because they would be disgusted. I mean my mom gets mad at me for saying \u201cshit\u201d. She\u2019s really super nice and sweet. I mean she cried when she saw a homeless dude. Also, How should I tell my parents if you think I should.  (sorry for bad grammar)",

        "content": "Found my boyfriend's OnlyFans. To start off, I (24F) have known my boyfriend (27M) for awhile, we started off just hooking up as he was very clear he wasn't the dating type and then about 4 months ago things got very serious between us.  We started a real relationship and he has been the best partner to me. I've been in crappy past relationships and he knows all about them and was even my friend during my last toxic, narcissistic relationship.  So he knows I have been done wrong and hurt and cheated on.\n\nWe are very open and honest with each other and our feelings on porn.  He has always been a \"porn\" guy that likes to watch porn and jerk off and its just been a part of his daily life as he has been single for all his 27 years (I am his first actual girlfriend).  I have always known that about him and he's quite simply, a regular guy that likes to watch porn. I have never judged or faulted him for that and I do not have a problem with my partner watching regular porn because lets be honest, we all do.  \n\nHowever, we have had past conversations about how I am not comfortable with my partner paying for porn on cam girl or sights like OnlyFans as I feel like its too personal and crosses a different line than just watching free porn online.  I know he had an OnlyFans account but it said last used on March 8th (before we were together) and I have mentioned it to him and it has been a causal conversation about how he doesn't use it and I have believed him bc the activity status has never changed. \n\nWe kind of started living together over the last month, he told me to start moving my things from my apartment and I have stayed here every day / night...he got me Christmas gifts, takes me places, does all the regular wonderful relationship stuff...I have been hurt and cheated on and lied to before so I have a hard time trusting people, but I have genuinely trusted him and fallen into this relationship very easily.\n\nThis morning, I was rearranging the bedroom and he has a phone that sits on the nightstand he uses for crypto currency stuff, and I know he used to use it to watch porn, whatever, it's never been an issue and I have never questioned him. When I was dusting and moving everything around I was wiping off the dusty phone and it unlocked (no password on it) and the background apps that are still open came up and it was Safari with OnlyFans open...I know I should not have continued to look, I did not set out to open his phone, and once I saw it opened I should have closed it.  I know. But I think any person would see that on their partner's phone and feel obligated to investigate.  \n\nTurns out he has an account that is NOT the one I knew about, with a profile pic of his body and messages from I guess the accounts he subscribes too (I do not know how OnlyFans works, I'm assuming those are the people that message you? idk) But either way there were all pretty generic messages from the accounts \"Look at my new video\" etc. so on and so fourth, it upset me bc he obviously lied about having an account, but I figured it was old accounts because he was single forever so maybe they keep messaging all their subscribers, I really don't know.  But then I saw he responded to a couple of them since we have been dating, pretty stupid stuff like \"Keep up the good work\" or whatever, but on dates that we were together...I honestly was in such shock I cannot remember the details.  \n\nI do not know how to approach this, how do I bring it up? I was honestly and innocently organizing our bedroom...I did not intend to find or look for anything and I am afraid even mentioning it will start a fight about \"why don't you trust me why are you going through my stuff\"...what is a good way to approach this? Is it cheating? I feel very insecure and crappy about myself now and how can I get past my partner seeking out other women naked...is it just him being a guy?\n\nAnything helps, thank you.",

        "content": "I broke up with my girlfriend after 2 years together and now feel numb, guilty, and still attached.. Hi Reddit, I really need some outside perspective.\n\nI\u2019m 19M and my ex is 18F. We were together for 2 years, starting in junior year of high school. She was my first love. My first everything. Earlier this year, I ended things after a long period of conflict, and I\u2019m trying to understand if I have an avoidant or fearful-avoidant attachment style.\n\nSome context:\nA few months ago, she found a list of pornstars in my notes app, which led to a huge argument. To be honest, I had planned it in a way to \u201ccatch\u201d her snooping because I suspected she was going through my private stuff. This was an issue in high school and the following years when I expressed to her I didn\u2019t want her going through my phone. I had valuable information in there I didn\u2019t want her to know, such as my personal journaling on my notes app and gifts I had planned to buy for her in my safari app. Along with personal and security reasons. But I was immature and decided to pull that move to catch her, but that also caused a huge argument.\n\nDuring that argument, I finally told her something I\u2019d been hiding: I was SA\u2019ed by another girl during my first week at college. I had gotten near-blackout drunk and couldn\u2019t remember much of my night except little scenes, which included a girl SA\u2019ing me on the dance floor, then me realizing what had happened as I was still nearing blacking out. Since then, I\u2019ve struggled with shame, guilt, and feeling unworthy. I hadn\u2019t gone to anyone about being SA\u2019ed, so for the months before I ultimately told her, the shame and fault had tore me apart each day. I just felt so ashamed that it happened to me that I didn\u2019t tell her the next morning. Even though I knew I should\u2019ve told her as soon as possible.\n\nAfter telling her this, I told her I wasn\u2019t good enough for her and that she deserved better. I basically tore myself down, almost like I was trying to push her away to make it easier for her to leave me. She tried to reason, but I told her straight up that I point-blank cheated on her, that I was not worth her love, and I was a monster and manipulated her. All attempts to push her away and make it easier for her to leave me. As I was afraid to pull the trigger of breaking up.\n\nInstead, we went on a break for about 4\u20135 weeks. During that time, we still texted here and there, but I felt numb. No relief, no sadness, no anger\u2014just nothing. When she asked if I ever cried about us, I told her the truth: I thought about her, but I didn\u2019t cry. I just felt empty.\n\nWe tried no contact. I broke it once when I found out she was going to a frat date party, because I got upset and texted her. But eventually, I gave all her gifts back (notes, stuffed animals, paintings) and blocked her everywhere so I could heal. I distracted myself from the thoughts of her by keeping myself busy with school and athletics. Then I finally felt a little relief, no more responsibilities and emotional attachments that were tied to my ex. After a while she posted a TikTok about letting go and no longer loving me, and coincidently two days later, I went to her dorm, said my final goodbyes, and gave her a note explaining why I ended things. That same day, I started seeing someone new. I was convinced I was over her, deleted everything and blocked her on everything to let a new door open while shutting the old door.\n\nNow I\u2019m in a new relationship, but until recently i\u2019ve been dreaming about my ex. Dreams where we\u2019re yelling, crying, or trying to fix things. I wake up about to cry or feeling nothing. Then I get hit with a flood of emotions the following days. It was so bad that I couldn\u2019t sleep some nights, often staying up until the morning. I told my current girlfriend about my situation and she understands how I am feeling and is willing to let me process these emotions.\n\nFor a while now i\u2019ve had my ex blocked and no-contact was going fine. But recently I find myself checking her social media on a burner account. Even though I know I shouldn\u2019t. I was doing just fine not checking it or being reminded of her for the past few months. But now I feel homesick for a home no longer mine. I still care for her, and I want her happy with or without me.\n\nFor background, I never really got love and care from my parents the way other kids did. I was never supported much growing up, and even now as i\u2019m an adult I don\u2019t speak to my parents at all, other than occasional small talk that is extremely awkward to hold. Could this be cause for avoidant-attachment or fearful-avoidance? I haven\u2019t gone to therapy yet as I deemed it unnecessary.\n\nI just want some outside perspective on this.\nIs this an avoidant attachment pattern? Fearful-avoidant? Or something else?\nWhy do I feel numb and detached but still obsessively think about her?\nAm I hurting my current girlfriend by not fully letting go of my ex?\nHow do I start healing in a healthy way instead of trying to distract myself and stay busy?\n\nAny insight or similar experiences would help. Thanks for reading all this. I just want to understand myself better so I don\u2019t keep repeating the same patterns. Thanks!",

        "content": "2 Days til Flight. Ok, let me set the scene for you. I was traveling abroad last year when I met a seemingly wonderful man during a group trip. I extended my trip and spent a week alone with him- traveling, exploring, having a magical time.\n\nWe\u2019ve continued talking regularly. He frequently tells me I\u2019m the love of his life, etc. naturally I\u2019m a bit more guarded. Realistically, he\u2019s halfway around the world but I enjoyed talking to him.\n\nI\u2019m supposed to be flying back to his home country (Africa, for reference) in two days. He\u2019d planned a 10 day safari for us, sent me the full itinerary. I\u2019m stoked to going back to my favorite continent.\n\nLate last night, I receive a message stating that he can\u2019t go in safari me. I\u2019m confused but think there must be some reasonable explanation. I know he has a sick parent- perhaps they passed away? \n\nI\u2019m standing at my bathroom sink when I hear the familiar ding from my phone. I glance down to see a message from this man\u2019s wife- she\u2019s included a wedding picture. Not only does this man have a whole wife but they also have 2 small children. Fuck.\n\nOk so here\u2019s my dilemma. I have all my shots, I\u2019ve taken the time off from work & my flight is non-refundable.\n\nDo I plan my own itinerary over the next 24 hours?? It would be my first time navigating a foreign county solo. \n\nShould I eat the cost or wing it alone?",

I saw that just before going abroad for a year (student exchange). I talked with him just before going because I felt it was going to be a pain keeping that for myself one entire year. He was very confused when I mentioned what I saw.\nHere is what he told me:\n\n*   \"thanks for telling me\"\n*  \"I visited these sites because I was curious\"\n*  \"I was curious because I heard about these sites at work\"\n*  \"I didn't meet anyone\"\n* \"I didn't like what I saw on these websites\"\n* \"Your mom doesn't know about that\"\n* \"Don't tell your mom\"\n\n**Here is the context:**\n\nMy dad works very hard in the capital city. On week ends he lives in the countryside with my mom and my little brother who is 10 years old (Me and my brother have the same parents). He works in the capital city from monday to thursday and goes back home on thursday night. I also have a sister who is two years younger than me, she's studying abroad too. My mom works too, she\u2019s an artist. My dad\u2019s family is catholic and has recently suffered from the divorce of my dad\u2019s brother. My mom\u2019s parents were very affected too by the divorces of my aunts. \nI already seen porn sites on my dad\u2019s phone, he is very often on private navigation on his phone\n\n**Current situation:**\n\nIt felt great to talk with my dad before going, I was released even if I wasn\u2019t sincerly convinced. Then, living abroad for the first time, I forgot a little bit about this story. It\u2019s been 4 months I left my country now and I\u2019m starting to think about it again. I told a few friends about this story (no one in my family though). I now think my dad lied to me. **My parents come to visit me in december for two weeks and I\u2019m anxious about this.** I have never talked to my dad about that since I left. \n\n* Do you guys think I should try to know more about this story by talking with my dad? \n* Is it my business? \n* Should I wait the end of my studies (next summer)? \n* Do you think my dad definetly lied to me?\n* Do you think I should talk to my sister about this? \n\nThanks for reading and excuse my english ;)",

I had to a new create an account for this post as my fianc\u00e9 is a big Reddit user but I\u2019m desperate for advice!\n\nI [33F] think my fianc\u00e9 [35M] maybe bisexual & I don\u2019t know what to think or feel right nonetheless discuss it with him.\n\nI came home from work late tonight so when I got home, I see that my fianc\u00e9 fell sleep on our bed with his laptop on my side... I got in bed and couldn\u2019t go to sleep right away so decided to use his laptop for some online shopping. Well when I logged into it, I realize he left a safari window still open on the Reddit site. I noticed it wasn\u2019t his accounts username (the only one I know of) so as I hate to admit, I snooped and saw that account was leaving sexual comments on bisexual and gay subreddits as well as sexual women one as well. \n\nI don\u2019t have any issues with people who are bisexual or gay, shit some of my closest friends are gay but this I do have an issue with & in shock. My fianc\u00e9 doesn\u2019t even like ass play... If I even go near it with a finger during sex he freaks out and gets upset. I have an issue with this since he acts super homophobic, even seeing men kiss on TV.\n\nI don\u2019t understand this and my anxiety right now is on high! Why is he leaving comments on bisexual and gay subreddits from a secret account when he acts so homophobic and doesn\u2019t like ass play?!? This is so daunting on my mind and now I know I\u2019m going to acting weird with him as soon as we start speaking in the am.\n\nI have no clue what to do... How to process this even. Especially how to bring this up to discuss because i feel like he\u2019s going to get embarrassed and mad... I think it might be so bad how he got caught that he may even leave me. I don\u2019t know, please help with some advice!",

        "content": "I feel like my friend group is dissolving and I don't know how to fix it.. So to preface this: I've known most of these people since middle school, I am a sophomore in college now so I've known most of the people in the group for over 8 years at this point, but with passing contact since I went to a different high school than them. After high school I started talking to a few of them more regularly and they invited me to join their friend discord server. I joined, then within a few months some massive drama happened which resulted in one member leaving (he had been antagonizing our other friend and when asked to stop repeatedly would feign innocence, or claim that he hadn't done it. I never experienced any of it, but was given a very detailed run down of everything leading up to that point). But after that we all agreed to talk more and try and figure things out before they become nuclear level events. \n\nOf course the road to hell is paved with good intentions, things got tense again between myself and my friend who I'll call Clara for the sake of anonymity. We talked it out, and the two of us were talking again. I won't lie I am a very loud person, I don't hide that fact and have made it very clear that I'm loud, and at times obnoxious without meaning to be. Roughly 2 months after I joined another member was added (a friend-of-a-friend type situation) who I'll call Luisa. She's very similar to me in that we are both really loud and will quote or repeat things we hear or watch to each other (echolalia go brrrr), well Clara and a few other friends didn't like this, and would constantly bag on us for being loud, to which we would tone it down considerably so. But anytime things get talked about in the group it always gets referenced back (like we were deciding on a new server theme since the safari theme we currently have has gotten old, and the idea of cats was suggested to which almost immediately a few of them went \"I hate it, because Venus and Luisa are just going to meow constantly\" which for a while was a common thing we would do back and forth, but when group members told us it was obnoxious we stopped.) Luisa and I are rather close despite only knowing each other for about a year now. And we talk often about some of the things happening within the group since more often than not it leads to us two feeling left out since the rest of the group (about 6-7 people) are much closer with each other than we are to them. (It's something that I'm working towards, but it's difficult with so much tensity in the group). \n\nRecently something happened to Luisa which caused her to be absent from calls for a few days (we typically would all be in call just about every night just talking and hanging out), then another member is visiting family and can't join calls at all since the reception where he's at is pretty bad (we'll call him Mark). Well Mark and Luisa were sorta the glue of the group if that makes any sense. Mark was the connector between me and the group since I was closest with him, Luisa was another connector as she always brings a sortof lightness to the group that we all need since we're a bunch of 20 something college kids trying to figure out life, and she's really good at being that sorta carefree bright friend who always knows the right things to say. But without either of them in calls things have felt tense. Nowadays only a few people join calls, and if the others do its for a few minutes before they leave to go do something else. \n\nI want to say something to the group about it, because it is affecting me, but I don't want it to seem like I'm pointing fingers or placing blame on anyone when I just want us to feel like friends again. But I don't know how to say that without potentially making someone feel like I'm blaming them, or rocking the boat. (the last time I said something that \"rocked the boat\" it almost lead to me leaving the server because it was made into a \"who's side are you on\" thing, and became something massive despite me trying to keep it small between myself and Clara. So I'm terrified of creating another situation like that). \n\nI don't want to leave the server and I know I'm not faultless with this situation, but it feels like the group is dissolving and I don't know what to do, or even if me doing anything would solve it. Any and all advice is appreciated.",

I 16yold female, saw a safari suggestion on my dad\u2019s phone in october 24 and it was tinder, My brother came and approached my dad ab it but he shouted at him and told him he\u2019s trying to ruin everything , From that moment i couldn\u2019t help but observe my fathers behaviours, He works abroad. But i noticed that he bought himself a convertible, And has become more interested in gym/his looks, Which isn\u2019t bad but , He had hid the car from family and i found out by choice, And also, In 2023, Me and my brother found out he had downloaded tinder and hinge and many dating apps, So i couldn\u2019t help but think he was doing something, A fe days ago , My mother was complaining to me that she feels my dad has been distant from her, So i told her that when he came back from travelling there was a pink stain on his shirt, And she didn\u2019t notice, I thought this would make her more aware, And that when she gets back she could see for herself, But yesterday, She saw the shirt and then instead got mad at me for even thinking that my dad could cheat or do something bad like that, But then i couldn\u2019t stop myself and the words just came out as i was trying to defend myself and then told her that i only said it bc i saw my father on tinder again, It was heartbreaking to see her reaction , And then my brother revealed to her that he saw on my dads gmail a tinder subscription from 2020(tinder gold) and he told her that on my dads google maps , It said he was at a s**krip club, And obviously she was devasted . The next day i wake up and my dads screaming and shouting and he slaps my mum and tells her he wants a divorce , She is now heartbroken , But my dad said this in the midst of anger , After speaking to him he said he regrets what he did to her, Abd he swore on his dead dad he never opened tinder, And i had no evidence bc it was only on safari suggestions . But now my mum is no contact with my dad for a few days, He knows he\u2019s messed up, And now my mum is starting to blame me for everything. I feel like i ruined everything , Bur i should have never been involved . from a young age i should have never been involved in their marriage , But they made it like this. I feel horrible as if i ruined their marriage and broke my mums heart. She now is starting to resent me , And so is my dad. What do i do??",

The evidence is right here.\u201d And then he finally admitted to it. He says it\u2019s because we don\u2019t have sex often and he was weak and was curious. He claims men are curious and he was curious about herand looked up her onlyfans. He has apologized many many times at this point and knows he did something wrong.\n\nI know he didn\u2019t cheat but he still denied it and he knew he was wrong bc he deleted his tabs off safari. He knew he was wrong. He tried to deny it. We have had a few problems with intimacy but we got over it. I just don\u2019t like that he lied about it. I am so hurt and upset because he has nudes of me on his phone and claims I am enough\u2026.yet I don\u2019t feel like I am enough because he had to jerkoff to a strangers onlyfans and not the photos he has of me. Am I being dramatic? Should I let this go? I feel so hurt and sad by this.",

My father has invited me to come up with an idea for an interesting vacation with him, \"like maybe a safari or something, or, I dunno, the Mediterranean\".  \n\nThe trip would be next summer, and we could probably give it two weeks or so; he has the resources to make pretty much any experience happen in relatively upscale style.  \n\nI'm looking for suggestions from the Reddit community to help us decide where we should go, and why.     \n\nConditions for the \"ideal\" vacation: \n\n1.  It can't be somewhere we've gone before together.  Previous trips included a jaunt across Spain, the heart of Memphis, Nebraska (it was his 50th state; he needed it to complete the set), the California coastline, and Germany.   When I was a kid, he took the family to Israel/Egypt, Denmark, and Mexico; he's taken my wife and kids with us to Bermuda, Puerto Rico, and an Alaskan cruise.    \n\n2. My father has Parkinsons.  He can't stay out past, say, 10 most nights, and needs a few hours in the middle of each day to recharge.  I think he knows this is his last real opportunity to push ourselves, so he wants to go out with a bang.  \n\n3. We have a preference for relative luxury and low-energy yet high-intellectual impact activities, such as touring buildings or museums, local attractions and culture, or just exploring a city and its delights.  Driving is not a problem, as he's happy to let me drive.   Shared interests include folk and blues music, intellectual argument, social change, good food, and local history.

The other day my boyfriend and I went somewhere and I ended up needing to use his phone for something ,so I asked for it  and he opened it to safari and in the search bar it had onlyfans. I didn\u2019t know what to say so I just said \u201c um what is this \u201c and he told me he never uses safari , that if must be an old search. We\u2019ve only been in a relationship for about a month and a half but talking for almost 4 months. Idk I guess I chose to give him the benefit of the doubt in that moment because I do know he doesn\u2019t use safari as his main search engine so I just blew it off . But I was laying in bed last night thinking about it and I decided to look through his search history in safari just so see if it was old. I really honestly thought he was telling the truth. But he wasn\u2019t, it wasn\u2019t old the search was from the day before and I saw it directed him and asked for his drivers lisence and a picture so I\u2019m pretty sure he has a subscription of some sort. I just don\u2019t understand why he would lie. I\u2019ve told him before how uncomfortable I am with that kind of stuff and honestly if he\u2019s going to look at porn I\u2019d much rather it just be randoms, not a woman he\u2019s paying to see naked specifically. I wish I would\u2019ve never looked, now I don\u2019t know how to confront him about this .",

        "content": "Financially unstable boyfriend advice needed!. Buckle up Reddit! This might be a long one.\n\nTo preface this story, I (25f) caught my boyfriend (31m) with an OnlyFans account in March while I was on his DoorDash app ordering food at the same time he received an email notification from OF. I was upset because our sex life isn\u2019t the greatest and I\u2019ve felt rejected by him in the past. I explained to him that I wasn\u2019t naive enough to believe that I would stop him from watching porn, but I draw the line with OnlyFans because why are you paying money for something you can get for free?? And he was \u201cpurchasing\u201d (wording of his emails from OF) personalized content, which crosses boundary for me and I made that CRYSTAL clear . He originally lied, saying they were previous subscriptions that he hadn\u2019t canceled. I pointed out that one of the emails from less than 10 days ago thanked him for his \u201cnew subscription,\u201d and called him out for lying straight to my face. He understood, apologized, cried, etc and promised it wouldn\u2019t happen again.\n\nFast forward 4 1/2 months and I\u2019ve tried to trust him and trust that anything done in the \u201cdark\u201d will come to light (here we are!). Tonight we were deciding on dinner and looking through different recipes on his laptop. We decided on one, and he was asking me to clarify instructions throughout while he was in the kitchen. About midway through, I decided to briefly \u201ccheck\u201d on his new laptop\u2019s activity. I went to the top of the browser, typed in \u201conl\u201d (specifically only those 3 letters to see what would come up)  and the FIRST recommended search from the browser was \u201conly fans login.\u201d I already know there\u2019s no way this is the \u201cnorm\u201d and confirmed on my iPhone\u2019s safari. When I typed \u201conl\u201d on my own device, \u201conly the brave,\u201d \u201conly murders in the building,\u201d and \u201conline safety act\u201d were the first things to come up.\n\nI will tag on that he also quit his \u201cstable\u201d job at the beginning of April, and has been getting paid about $1000 every 3 or so weeks (we live in CA, rent is $2.1k/month, he has never helped with utilities/gas/wifi/insurance). Mind you this is post-me finding out about his original OnlyFans spending. He complained to me last week about being down to $3.00 in his bank account and not being able to buy groceries while I was on vacation. \n\nI already know this is nuts and he needs to be shown the door\u2026 but Reddit WTF?? At what point does it click in a 31yo\u2019s head that this isn\u2019t financially sane? \n\nTLDR: Financially unstable boyfriend continues to spend money on porn! :)",

        "content": "How do I fix my parents parenting with my kid sister?. I (28F) have a kid sister (8F), same parents. I lived with her for 7 years and recently moved to another state. I helped raise her. \n\nMy sister has an iPad addiction. She spends her time outside of school glued to her iPad, either playing roblox or watching YouTubers play roblox. \n\nLast year, I noticed she was being overprotective over the iPad and needed to delete tabs before I searched something. Quickly out she was looking up porn and she looked frightened. She had a panic attack crying and begged me not to tell my parents and told me she was embarrassed. I calmly told her she can\u2019t watch that stuff and we had a brief sex talk. I told her to come to me if she had any questions. I monitored her browser history for a while. My brother and I caught her making searches again, but this time I learned she discovered incognito mode. I disabled safari completely. \n\nSeveral months later, my brother and I caught her making porn searches on YouTube. Apples kids restrictions is awful and didn\u2019t work (literally their kids version is or was glitched at the time and did not work at all). I also discovered during this time she\u2019s been chatting w strangers online on roblox. I restricted her roblox account to not allow chat and I deleted YouTube. \n\nI moved to another state and my sister in law caught her chatting with strangers and using safari again. I found out my parents gave in to letting her do all this because she throws tantrums. My parents say they need her to have an iPad other wise she won\u2019t eat, attend her supplemental classes, and she starts screaming and hitting my mom. It\u2019s frustrating. I know how awful and wrong this sounds and it makes me feel so defeated that I can\u2019t physically be down there to discipline her myself. \n\nAfter doing some research, I decided to download Kidslox which monitors her web search and allows me to block stuff on the iPad. I thought this was working. I found out she\u2019s been using my moms phone to watch unrestricted YouTube. I also found out that my dad gave her a desktop at home and she\u2019s made multiple accounts and uses roblox on the desktop. The Kidslox app notified me she made a potentially inappropriate search today \u201croblox text to speech dirty\u201d. It blocked the search for her but when I made the search, the videos I found on YouTube made my skin crawl. \n\nI\u2019m angry and I just about had it. I want to accomplish the following:\n\n- treat her iPad addiction \n- Treat her roblox addiction\n- Teach her to respect my parents \n- Explain to my parents the dangers of roblox and talking to strangers online\n\nHere are my roadblocks:\n\n- my parents. My immigrant mom acts like she has no idea how technology works. My mom is lazy and doesn\u2019t engage my sister in activities outside. She had my sister at 40 and always claims she\u2019s too tired. My dad enables my sister and gives Her everything she wants. My parents blame each other when I confront them about giving in to my sisters demands. When I or my brother have tried to talk to my mom, she deflects or disassociates from the conversation. She makes excuses. \n- I live too far away from everyone and this is draining me. I want to move back down or have her live with me. \n- Gentle parenting and embarrassing her. I worry that my parents will helicopter parent the crap out of her after I tell them everything she\u2019s been doing. \n\nI\u2019d like help in how I can talk to my parents about this situation and how much I should share.\n\nI\u2019d also like help in how to speak to my sister about this entire situation. Currently, she thinks I don\u2019t know about her multiple roblox accounts.",

        "content": "I desperately need advice about my boyfriend and OF girls in his search history. So my boyfriend and I (both 18) have been dating for around a year now. Everything is perfect, we talk through any problems and always work things out. There have only really been a few issues in our relationship but we have always resolved them. I trust the man with my life, I always thought of him as the \u201cbest of men.\u201d He cares for me in a way I have never been cared for. We have plans to move in together soon. We bring out the best in each other, and I was so convinced he was obsessed with me and had eyes for no other woman. \n\nUntil today. For context we\u2019ve been in a long distance relationship where we are away from one another for two month long periods. He\u2019s home currently and just got back about two weeks ago. About a month into our last period of physical distance, we started fighting more, and our e-relationship became significantly more sexual (embarrassing but I promise I\u2019m not an incel) but I passed it off as a symptom of depression, heavy weed use, and missing one another and our distance. But when he got back to town, I could feel when I kissed him that he always wanted more. And I often gave in, not like I really minded, but you guys know how hard it is to stop the process of sex. He\u2019s tried to have sex every single time we\u2019ve hung out. He constantly makes dirty jokes. \n\nIt has always been a strict boundary in our relationship that we don\u2019t look at anybody else. No porn, no checking other people out, no entertaining people. We have always thought it fair and have followed it. His social media has never been full of half naked women or any of that stuff. But today, I may have looked on his phone while he was sleeping (bad, I know) and I found OnlyFans links in his instagram visited links. I clicked on them, and you can\u2019t really see anything upon initially visiting them, and he doesn\u2019t seem to have an OF account, but one of the OF links was also in his Safari search history, saying it had been opened a week ago. \n\nMy heart dropped to my stomach because this man has always been so perfect to me. For a while, I thought he was almost womanlike because of how kind and caring he was. I talked to him about it, and he said his instagram is occasionally spammed with random OF girls and he doesn\u2019t interact with them. He does, however, play a game with himself to guess if a girl does OnlyFans? We\u2019ve talked about like the OnlyFans girl \u201clook\u201d before in conversation (like specific makeup, body type, nothing derogatory) but he said essentially when he sees a reel by a girl who has that OF \u201clook,\u201d he goes to check if he was right. He visits the links in their pages that don\u2019t explicitly say OnlyFans, but are often an array of links, including OnlyFans. The problem with that is, his history shows he initially clicked on their OVERALL link page, and then clicked the OF link off that page. There\u2019s also a link to some other girls porn site that isn\u2019t OF. There\u2019s also a link in his Safari search history, and the basic OnlyFans page in his Safari search history. He says they must\u2019ve opened from Instagram but he genuinely does not know. He doesn\u2019t have an account, his bank account, cashapp\u2014everything\u2019s clean. \n\nBut when I confronted him about it, and was visibly upset, he quickly became meaner and angrier when I didn\u2019t initially believe him. He threatened to leave and break up with me, which he later apologized for, but the immediate anger response after not being initially trusted makes me feel as though he is lying. \n\nI love him more than anything, and I\u2019ve trusted him more than anything, but I cannot be stupid and I refuse to believe him just because I want to. I was under the impression that I was going to spend the rest of my life with this man and I just don\u2019t know what to think. Can someone please help me and tell me what to do?",

        "content": "I just found out my mums cheating on my dad what do I do now. I literally just found out and its 4am so sorry if this post doesnt make sense. So my mum f40 is cheating on my dad m48, I'm currently in secondary school and have very bad attendance to the point were the council and teachers in my area are constantly nagging me and my parents for me to go to school, meetings, group therapy things, all of that type of stuff. And If I'm honest with you it's stressing me and my parents out. But recently I've been getting better and I'm trying to fix it.\n\nAnyways my mums polish and my dad's British and I don't live near either sides of my family so I'm not close with any of them at all, and every family gathering I'm always treated as if I don't have feelings or as if I'm not even there. And I know once my parents die im gonna have none to very little contact with them.\n\nAnd now timeskip to earlier today around 11pm, I turned on my mums ipad to watch some YouTube in my bed and eat some food and just relax you know, I go on safari (basically google) and I see a few tabs i didnt open and one of them says 'best dating apps for the uk' my dad doesn't use this ipad at all and I don't have any siblings and I know for a FACT I didn't search this up... so it had to have been my mum. I dont want to overthink this, I mean my parents marriage has been great recently, they've been going on dates and watching movies and beening all lovely dovie. Timeskip to literally 40 minutes ago (3:59am) I text one my bestfriends, \"I think my mums cheating on my dad\" \"when I was texting my dad on my mums phone yesterday some weird man kept sending her weird notifications.\" Around 10 minutes later (4:10). I text her, \"she's asleep right now I'm gonna go take her phone and have a look\" 1 minute later \"SHES CHEATING ON HIM\" I go onto WhatsApp at first I see the man who was texting her yesterday, and now there's a another man, I didn't stroll done the contacts list I just clicked on the chat the man and my mum shared, it seemed normal at first but then I see paragraphs and many messages of dirtys texts, the man planning airbnbs, nudes, i took pictures of some of the messages so i had proof just i case i need to tell my dad. All of it. I got to about the messages from early February but stopped I put the phone down and just broke down,after a bit I calmed down and put the phone back next to my mum making sure there was no evidence I was on her phone.\n\nAnyways sorry this is so long but i don't know what to do, I don't wanna tell my dad because I'm already really stressed out and I don't want my parents to divorce, and even if they do they will probably still live tougher because moneys tight.. which will cause more tension, and I'm already the least favourite in both sides of the family and I don't wanna be even more hated because I recked my parents marriage so please help me.",

        "content": "Tired of finance lying to me about porn addiction , any advice ?.   So just for context , I\u2019m 19 and he\u2019s also 19. We met 4 years ago in school and we just had a baby last year in August. And he proposed to me in December. So to start off, I found stuff first on his insta. His algorithm changed from normal stuff to explicit women. I got suspicious and went on to Facebook and found him searching random people , and then found videos of women. I said something about it and he deleted it. Now let me just make it clear , I didn\u2019t tell him to do that. He said he didn\u2019t \u201cknow\u201d how it got there.. I knew he was lying I just deeply care for him I want to make things work especially cause we have a daughter. \n  Anyways I left it alone. Now I noticed he was being weird with his phone a few months after that. So I went to look through his tik tok and again found more women he\u2019s watching. I brought it up to him and told him how it\u2019s disappointing to keep seeing that he can\u2019t let this habit go. He keeps saying \u201cI don\u2019t have a habit\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not watching that my phone accidentally clicks on- blah blah just IMAGINE the excuses. Then he deleted tik tok like he did with Facebook. Again I didn\u2019t ask him to, it honestly makes me mad that he does that because I feel like he has no self control. Anyways I moved on from it. Next occurrence, I was using his phone to search up a place to eat. I go on safari, it\u2019s on private. It was asking for Face ID, and I told him hey open the tab please. He opens it and I guess he forgot he had porn on there cause that\u2019s what opened up , xxx videos and he yanked the phone and deleted not just one tab but TABS. He had it tilted away so I couldn\u2019t see anything. I didn\u2019t know I could\u2019ve just opened it with his passcode either, I just found out i could have done that and I wish I would\u2019ve known to really see if he\u2019s lying again. He said he didn\u2019t watch anything and he felt nasty being on it. That he just left the site after it loaded. \n  I honestly don\u2019t know what to believe anymore. I left it alone I was disgusted already. After that I went way back to see if he was doing this since the start. He sure was. He was watching women since I was 5 months postpartum is what I\u2019ve found out , and I don\u2019t know how to feel about it and how to deal with it in a healthy way for my daughter. I do everything for this man I cook I clean , I do little things like clean his car, I\u2019ve helped him get a car , get a job when we were dead broke,we grew up overnight tg and I\u2019ve helped him with so much and it feels like such a betrayal. \n  I try to do things as a family for my baby girl and we always end up arguing, he gets tense if my daughter starts throwing a tantrum and I\u2019m so used to it I just block it out. Idk it seems like he only enjoys me if we\u2019re baby free and that sucks. I don\u2019t work , he\u2019s the breadwinner but it\u2019s because I just finished school and I just dropped everything to raise my daughter, we decided that\u2019s what would work for now. We live with my parents at the moment and I haven\u2019t told anybody about this. It\u2019s hard too because my family adores him and he\u2019s an amazing dad regardless , he shows up and works for his daughter morning to night and I respect him for that. I just don\u2019t feel appreciated. We stay with my parents, and it\u2019s hard sleeping in the same bed while dealing with this. I wake up so heavy hearted. He tries to touch me but it\u2019s hard to be intimate with him. All I can see and think of are the things I found on his phone. \n  I\u2019ve been loyal to this man since I was 16 , I\u2019m about to turn 20 this year. I\u2019m scared I\u2019m going to waste my life trying to save this for my daughters sake. I want to be happy but I don\u2019t want to ruin my daughter\u2019s relationship with her dad or stress myself out more by separating.",

        "content": "Is this emotional abuse?. I've (15F) always had a pretty rocky relationship with my dad, and due to the coronavirus/being stuck together in a house for the past couple months we've been fighting way more than usual. We had a particularly nasty one today, and as a result I've been reflecting a lot on the way he's treated me. I may be a bit biased, but in no particular order, here are some things he's said/threatened to me.\n\n\\-On multiple occasions, he's threatened to set up my younger siblings for adoption as punishment for something I've done. (Maybe a joke? This happened when I was like 8-10 and actually thought he'd do it)\n\n\\-told me I'm the reason our family has been falling apart when he's mad\n\n\\-threatened to divorce my mother because of me\n\n\\-also told me I'm the reason why he will divorce my mother (again, when I was like 10 or something and didn't really get what was going on with their relationship)\n\n\\-told me I've been faking my anxiety attacks (I might be, but I don't really think I have been faking them. I know what the symptoms are but am not allowed to get a therapist or to seek a diagnosis because I'm \"faking\" it)\n\n\\-He's put time limits (through a IOS feature) on all my social media (20 minutes on safari/messages/insta/snap/facetime etc.)  and has threatened to run over my phone/ destroy it whenever we argue. (he's already destroyed my 11 year old brothers phone)\n\n\\-also limited my calling time on my phone so all voice/facetime calls are turned off from 10:30 p.m. to 8:30 a.m. (I get this as I have to sleep, but it's frustrating sometimes when I really need to just talk to someone and I can't; especially since the past couple months I haven't been out once) (I'm not allowed out at all because of the virus and haven't seen any of my friends) I guess I kind of deserve this one because I abused his trust by calling people too late.\n\n\\-told me my self harm was attention seeking because I've only cut myself a couple times. (this one might be true? I only really self harm after we fight so maybe I was trying to prove something or get back at him?)\n\n\\-Doesn't believe me when I try to explain my actions to him anymore because I lied to him once about how much time I was spending on my phone. I had found a way to bypass the time restrictions once and didn't tell him. Now, whenever he finds out I'm doing something he doesn't agree with and I argue with him he pulls the \"I know you lie a lot\" card. I do think I may be a pathological liar and also want to go to a therapist to get help for that, but again, I'm not allowed to.\n\nBig disclaimer!! I'm a healthy 15 year old who has hobbies and friends and exercises/plays a sport. I haven't been that suicidal/depressed and all that in a year, which I'm proud of. However, I know some people who have the same issues as I have with their parents as well, and was simply wondering if this categorizes as some form of abuse or if all parent children relationships have their low points .

Long story short, the agent changed one of our hotels from a 4 star to a 3 star hotel, with a price difference of $1500, and he isn\u2019t changing the hotel back (saying now it is fully booked which we confirmed with the 4 star hotel that it is), or giving us the difference in price back. To add context, our driver is sympathetic and even arguing with his boss (in English and on loudspeaker as a group) to try and help us fix the situation. He is a very passionate guy and a great guide (he is in the process of getting licensing for his own agency and leaving this company), so I don\u2019t want to do anything to the driver. \n\nWhat can I do as I am not in the position of power after sending the remaining money. I am thinking about giving a bad reviews and reporting to the Kenyan government travel department. Any other suggestions?",

        "content": "How to deal with rude neighbours without escalating. Hello, long time lurker first time poster, apologies for the formatting I\u2019m on mobile. I just moved into a new apartment, and while it has tenant parking there isn\u2019t assigned parking spots, there are 6 spots, 5 are useable as one is blocked by the dumpster, the other option is to pay for city parking. I am currently parking there as I have not had time to get a city parking permit as I have just moved in. Today, after I came back from running an errand with my roommate (we took her car) I found a fake parking ticket on my windshield. It says this, word for word:\n\u201cPARKING VIOLATION. This is not a ticket, but if it were within my power, you would receive two. Because of your Bill Headed, inconsiderate, feeble attempt at parking, you have taken enough space for a 20 mule team, 2 elephants, 1 goat and a safari of pygmies from the African interior. The reason for giving you this is so that in the future you may think of someone else, other than yourself. Besides I don\u2019t like domineering, egotistical or simple minded drivers and you probably fit into one of these categories. I sign off wishing you an early transmission failure (on the expressway at about 4:30 p.m.). Also may the Fleas of a thousand camels infest your armpits.\u201d\nNow, if I had been parked badly I would understand, however my car was straight and completely in the spot, lined up with the cement marker. Another thing to note is that of the 5 available spaces, only 4 are being used. After finding this, I went and bought a dash cam and am planning on telling the building manager if something like this happens again, but I am wondering if I should do anything else or if anyone has any ideas why this may have been on my windshield to begin with? I have the \u201cticket\u201d, a picture of the \u201cticket\u201d and a video of my park job and will hopefully have time to get a city parking permit soon.\n\nEdit: spelling.",

        "content": "My boyfriend watches porn & I don\u2019t like it, what can I actually do to get him to stop?. ** edited to add TLDR\n\nTLDR: My boyfriend watches porn, I don\u2019t like it, I would like him to stop. I want him to feel bad when he go to watch it so that he ends up closing the tab or never opening one at all. He would feel enraged at the idea of me getting myself off to videos of other men. I would send him pics/vids every time he wants to watch porn if that meant he would stop entirely. For men, what things could your girlfriend do to actually get you to stop?\n\nThrowaway bc he\u2019s on reddit.\n\nI (23F) looked through my boyfriend\u2019s (25M) phone last night. I wasn\u2019t planning on it but he fell asleep and I picked up his phone to turn his alarms on and plug it in to charge. He left his safari tab open and then I started looking through other things. \n\nWe\u2019ve had a conversation about porn once before and I told him that I wasn\u2019t going to make him stop watching it all together, but that I did have some specific boundaries in regards to it. It would cross a line for me if he was watching cam girls/OF, paying for any porn, interacting/messaging/liking/commenting with any porn accounts, saving/downloading any of it, or becoming obsessed with a specific person. \n\nBasically, if he opens a tab to watch free porn, has zero interaction, then closes the tab, it\u2019s mostly fine to me as long as he also isn\u2019t choosing porn over me or watching so much that it starts to become an addiction issue. I don\u2019t like that he watches porn at all, but those were my specific hard no\u2019s. \n\nLast time we had this conversation, I told him how it made me feel emotionally and that the idea of him watching other women to get off made me feel bad about myself. He told me that the majority of the time, he just looks at videos/pictures of mine/ours, but that it wasn\u2019t a big deal for him to stop watching porn all together. I\u2019ve gone through his phone one other time after this convo and found porn so this is the second time now showing that he didn\u2019t actually stop watching it. \n\nI\u2019m not necessarily mad at him, especially because when we first started dating, I was still watching porn. But I stopped entirely pretty early on in our relationship because it made me uncomfortable getting off to other men. It made me feel guilty and it felt like I was disrespecting him or almost even cheating on him. \n\nHonestly I really just want to subtly bring up the porn topic and ask if he still watches it. Hoping he\u2019s truthful about it, but I want to reframe his perspective on it. I know for a FACT that he would feel internal rage at the idea of me getting off to other men. He is so protective and almost possessive of me (this isn\u2019t an issue in our relationship btw) that it would infuriate him. Not AT me, but just the idea of it would make him feel very jealous and upset.\n\nIf I bring up the topic in a casual way, I think I\u2019m gonna mention to him that I used to watch porn, but stopped in the beginning of our relationship because it felt disrespectful to him and then also bring up that for him to understand how I feel about it, I want him to imagine me touching myself to videos of other men. If I phrase it this way, I\u2019m wondering if something will click in his head and make him feel bad every time he goes to watch porn, and then I\u2019m hoping it brings his usage down or stops it entirely. \n\nI\u2019m also willing to make him a deal and send him pics/vids every time he has the urge to watch porn. Every. Single. Time. Genuinely. I don\u2019t care if i\u2019m at work, with my family, grocery shopping, if he\u2019s at home and wants to watch porn, I would much rather send him my stuff each time than for him to go get off to other women. For any men here, if your girlfriend did that for you, would it get you to stop? If not, what would it take for you to stop, that would actually be possible for her/both of yall to do?",

So I started looking for an iPad and the iPad air caught my attention. I was first thinking of getting an apple certified refurbished iPad air 4 but then I got worried that it won't last me at least 4 years without starting to become laggy/slow. Its already been out for about 3 years so I'm not sure if it will last me for at least 4 years. I will be mainly using the iPad for taking notes/doing hw for university and browsing social media and safari. I think I might do some multitasking while using safari too.\n\nShould I get the iPad Air 5 or will the iPad Air 4 be good?\n\nNote: I don't want the iPad gen 9",

I flipped mine and fell over on my side. The ATV fell on top of me. At the time, I felt nothing. Probably adrenaline.  However a few days later I can barely lift my right arm.. the leg pain is dissipated but a bit concerned about the soreness. \nI have soaked in hot tub and iced it.. I am trying to wait until I get back to the states.\nHas anyone ever fell off these vehicles  and did the soreness go away.\nNote: I understand this is just general advice and that most likely if this continues, seeking medical care will be my only alternative. Just trying to soothe my anxiety in the meantime.\n\nEDIT: I was in so much pain last night, I called a doctor. The pain in my shoulder is worse with certain movements. My arm is also weak.They gave me an IV cocktail of anti-inflammatory meds/vitamins/pain meds. They also cheduled an xray to rule out fractures. The medication took the edge off very slightly so thats a worry point for me. Like maybe its a fracture \ud83e\udd14..anyway I find out today.

Hello,\n\nI'm looking for a briefcase-laptop-messager bag, as BI4L as is possible within budget, $200-$400. \n\n## Motivation\n\n[Saddleback leather](http://www.saddlebackleather.com) came up frequenty in older posts on this, but their prices have  more than doubled to the $800-$1000 range. Other affordable brands that have been suggested in the past have raised their prices or are unavailable, so the information on this sub is not completely current. In particular, I found no current post that collected information for my requirements. I've gone through the sub history and compiled the relevant information in case someone else runs into the same problem I did.\n\n## Goal: \n\nI'm looking for something simple and professional. Minimalist and masculine. I hope to avoid prominent logos, and dislike the extreme outdoorsy designs like Saddleback. It's for business, but not the kind of business where expensive things are used as credentials. Simple, utilitarian, well made but not necessarily by hand or from rare materials. A timeless design for everyday use. I am looking for something with a leather finish or accents, but that uses more common materials structurally and for the lining. No need for all natural.\n\n## Compiling information from previous posts\n\n[Replies to this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/49uw0b/bifl_request_leather_messenger_baglaptop_bag/) state that no affordable well-made bags exist for my budget and aesthetic. And indeed, none of the suggested companies there suit. However! There is hope:\n\n[This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/log73/bi4l_request_leather_briefcaselaptop_bag/), with a similar price range, recommends [J.W. Hulme](http://www.jwhulmeco.com/briefcases-laptop-cases-s/112.htm), but their prices are also in the $800-$1000 range. [This bag, however, from Marco Poloni, at $340](http://www.marcopoloni.com/URBANO-zippered-messenger-bag.htm), is in budget. [Naragansett leathers](http://www.narragansettleathers.com/brief.html) is in semi-retirement with very low production volumes, so is not current.  \n\n[This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/21pnc5/bifl_best_casual_briefcasemessenger_bag/) has a similar budget, but is explicitly interested in the rugged look that I'm trying to avoid. However, I like [this copper river bag](http://www.copperriverbags.com/the-bolinas-17-rugged-brown-voyager-laptop-bag-made-in-the-u-s-a-17-v-br-lap/). [Leyden and sons](http://leydenandsons.com/ourbags/product-category/double-pocket-rugged-messenger-bag/) is on the higher end of the budget range, and also solidly in the rugged / outdoorsy camp, not right for me. (If you view Leyden and Sons website with Javascript blocked, you see that they are doing something underhanded for search-engine optimization, which makes me feel they are not trustworthy). The [safari](http://farhorizontraders.com/products/safari) bag from Far Horizon Traders is also good value, at $270 it is solidly in-budget.\n\n[This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/2b02ct/discussion_woodrough_leather_briefcase/) highlights the difficulty of identifying quality products in this price-range. The company in question, woodroughleather, has appropriately gone out of business. [Vagabond Traveler](http://www.vagabondtraveler.com/product/index.php?route=product/category&path=49) was recommended;\n\n[Here's another budget laptop/messenger bag post](https://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/3i3rso/bi4l_request_briefcasemessenger_bags/), with good links. [The Waterfield bags](https://www.sfbags.com/collections/shoulder-messenger-bags) are close to what I'm looking for. [Defy bags](https://defybags.com/collections/bags?page=4), [Filson](http://www.filson.com/briefcase-computer-bag.html), and [Zero Halliburton](http://zerohalliburton.com/work/laptop-tablet/), had good reviews from users, but weren't what I was looking for. In contrast, [Rugged matrial](https://www.ruggedmaterial.com/collections/all) and [Oak roads](https://www.oakroads.com/collections/briefcase-bags) are affordable, and I like the designs.\n\n[Another messanger-bag-on-student-budget post](https://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/3mi997/bifl_request_leather_bagbriefcase_that_is_durable/). Of the many excellent suggests, [Satchel & Page](http://www.satchel-page.com/collections/bags), [Gusti Leather](https://www.gusti-leather.co.uk/bags.html), and [Marlando](https://www.marlondoleather.com/collections/leather-briefcases) carry bags in the design I'm looking for. \n\n[This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/4y7cdz/bifl_request_casual_briefcase/) suggests [Highonleather](http://highonleather.com/collections/leather-messenger) is surprisingly cheap if they are really BI4L.\n\n## Summary\n\nMany affordable leather laptop/messenger bags have been recommended by BI4L users, that seem to compete with the higher priced brands. \n\n[Marco Poloni](http://www.marcopoloni.com/URBANO-zippered-messenger-bag.htm)\n - [Copper River](http://www.copperriverbags.com/the-bolinas-17-rugged-brown-voyager-laptop-bag-made-in-the-u-s-a-17-v-br-lap/)\n - [Far Horizon Traders](http://farhorizontraders.com/collections/cow-hide/products/serengeti)\n - [Vagabond Traveler](http://www.vagabondtraveler.com/product/index.php?route=product/product&path=49&product_id=1004&poip_ov=854)\n - [Waterfield](https://www.sfbags.com/collections/shoulder-messenger-bags/products/cargo-laptop-bag)\n - [Oak Roads](https://www.oakroads.com/collections/briefcase-bags)\n - [Rugged Material](https://www.ruggedmaterial.com/collections/all)\n - [Filson](http://www.filson.com/briefcase-computer-bag.html)\n - [Satchel and Page](http://www.satchel-page.com/collections/bags)\n - [Gusti Leather](https://www.gusti-leather.co.uk/bags.html)\n - [Marlando](https://www.marlondoleather.com/collections/leather-briefcases) - \n[High on Leather](http://highonleather.com/collections/leather-messenger)\n\nThe question is: what is the relative quality, value for each of these brands? For example, High-on-leather is cheap but has clearly fake reviews, which does not instill confidence. And I took Leyden and Sons off the list due to their weird search-engine optimization, but dubious advertising practices need not imply poor quality or value. \n\n## Shortlist\n\nSorted from least to most expensive\n\n[$66](https://www.gusti-leather.co.uk/bags/studio-sebastian-smart-business-satchel-2h36-26-1.html) - Gusti leather, price converted from pounds, does not state size\n\n[$88](https://www.gusti-leather.co.uk/bags/studio-mitch-smart-business-messenger-bag-2u4-17-1.html) - Gusti leather, price converted from pounds, 15\"\n\n[$98](https://www.gusti-leather.co.uk/bags/nature-alex-17-large-smart-satchel-u23.html) - Gusti leather, price converted from pounds, 16\"\n\n[$121](https://www.gusti-leather.co.uk/bags/studio-ned-large-smart-messenger-bag-2u42-17-7.html) - Gusti leather, price converted from pounds, 16\"\n\n[$143](https://www.gusti-leather.co.uk/bags/murray-leather-messenger-shoulder-bag-business-satchel-2u31-17-1.html) - Gusti leather, price converted from pounds, 16\"\n\n[$159](http://www.vagabondtraveler.com/product/index.php?route=product/product&product_id=1302) - Vagabond, on sale. 15\"\n\n$175 - Far Horizon's [Journeyer](http://farhorizontraders.com/collections/camel-leather/products/journeyer) and [Professor](http://farhorizontraders.com/collections/camel-leather/products/professor) bags, 16\"\n\n[$250](http://highonleather.com/collections/brown-leather-satchel-bag/products/saddleback-leather-briefcase) - High-on-Leather 16\" saddle bag; review looks fake?\n\n[$231](http://www.copperriverbags.com/copy-of-large-15-hemingway-briefcase-distressed-made-in-the-u-s-a-15-hem-dis-brc/) - Copper River Bag Co.'s \"Hemingway\" bags, 17'; +$58 ($288) with shoulder strap\n\n[$250](http://farhorizontraders.com/collections/cow-hide/products/sahara) - Far Horizon's Sahara bag; 16\", no laptop pocket.\n\n[$275](http://farhorizontraders.com/collections/cow-hide/products/safari) - Far Horizons Safari 16\", with laptop pocket.\n\n[$295](https://www.ruggedmaterial.com/products/classic-leather-messenger-bag-pullup-brown) - From Rugged Material, 16.5\"\n\n[$350](https://www.sfbags.com/collections/shoulder-messenger-bags/products/cargo-laptop-bag) - From waterfield bag, mix of synthetic; 16\"\n\n[$376](https://www.oakroads.com/collections/briefcase-bags/products/scully-leather-81st-aero-squadron-commodores-lambskin-briefing-case) - Oak Roads bag, 16.5\"\n\n[$379](https://www.sfbags.com/collections/shoulder-messenger-bags/products/rough-rider-messenger-bag) - Another waterfield bag; 16.5\", minimalist\n\n[$380](https://www.marlondoleather.com/collections/leather-briefcases/products/anglers-bag) - Marlando Angler's bag, 16\" \n\n[$388](https://www.oakroads.com/collections/briefcase-bags/products/jack-georges-voyager-brown-buffalo-leather-business-travel-bag) - Another Oak Roads bag; 15.5\"\n\n[$395](http://www.satchel-page.com/products/4-way-briefcase) - Satchel & Page 16.5\" briefcase, on sale now for \n\n[$435](http://www.satchel-page.com/products/mailbag) - Satchel & Page 16\" messenger bag, just  over-budget.\n\n## Questions\n\n1.

        "content": "Kelty Redwing 44 - 2016 Edition. My go anywhere, do anything pack.. I just came back from a climbing trip this morning and I was so impressed with this thing I had to tell someone.\n\nI bought this bag for my first international work abroad trip in Kenya. I was there for a month straight. It was my main luggage - I lived out of that pack for a month straight. Fit my work laptop plus accessories, clothes, food, other personal effects comfortably, solidly, without problem. I took it into the bush. Up country on \"safari\" with some friends who worked for the national park service in Kenya. We really roughed it out there. Again, fit everything I needed and then some and not a mark to show for being thrown about the back of an old restored British Colonial Land Rover from the 50s/60s (I'm not a car guy but it was old and angular in the back). I've made multiple trips out to Kenya and China since, with this bag serving as my luggage and field bag - a total of over 100 days as a professional and personal bag I sued in an office and way the fuck out in the field. I have never had a single reason to complain. \n\nSince then, I took up rock climbing. It has been my primary crag pack. Rope. Harness. Shoes. More shoes. Sport gear. Trad gear. Food. Water. First Aid. Maps/electronics. It carries everything. I've clipped it to a nut and slung it from a crack while me and my friends rooted around in there for gear or snacks. It slid down a chossy hill into a stump. It has been a bed for me one more than one occasion....No. Signs. Of. Wear. \n\nThis thing is just a bit dirty on the bottom, but nothing a bit of water cant clean up. No stitches out of place. No broken buckles. No frayed webbing. No discoloration. No compressed padding. This bag has done everything I have ever asked of it and it has done it with a smile on its face and spring in its step. This is the most comfortable bag I have ever worn while also carrying as little as 10lbs worth of office stuff up to ~50 lbs worth of camping/climbing gear. \n\nI have no idea if Kelty has made any meaningful changes to this pack since then, but I wish I had bought 4 just to ensure they keep making these things.\n\nI have no experience with anything else Kelty makes...if they made nothing else, I would be fine and we would consider ourselves lucky. I am a bit obsessed with backpacks and I have a lot of experience with many of the other relevant brands (REI, Osprey, Gregory, Northface before their mid capacity bags started sucking, MR, etc.) and though some of them have more modern features or are lighter or are better suited to some specific activities, This bag is my go to bag for everything unless I know I will need something with a lot more capacity, or if I need something tiny and lightweight. But for everything else, it is this bag.",

        "content": "[Request] Durable laptop bag. I know, I know, this question has been asked a bunch of times already. Trust me, I've read every thread, and I'm feeling overwhelmed.\n\nI'm looking for an everyday laptop bag that will fit a 15\" laptop and a few other items, most notably a pair of over-the-ear headphones. I'd like a *separate* laptop compartment, not just a sleeve, as that's the situation I'm currently dealing with. My budget is somewhere under $400, and it's okay with me if \"BIFL\" means 10-20 years with proper care. As far as styles go, I've seen and liked these:\n\n - Scully Aero Squadron ($370) https://www.oakroads.com/collections/briefcase-bags/products/scully-leather-81st-aero-squadron-commodores-lambskin-briefing-case\n - Far Horizons Savanna ($250) https://farhorizontraders.com/collections/cow-hide/products/savanna\n - Waterfield Bolt Medium, Chocolate/Black ($259) https://www.sfbags.com/collections/briefcases/products/bolt-briefcase#parentHorizontalTab2\n - Knomo Kobe ($245) https://www.knomobags.com/usa/sale/kobe-15-leather-messenger-brown.html\n\nI'm leaning toward one of the two \"old\" style bags - the Scully or the Savanna. I'm concerned, though, about the durability of those two, particularly give the reviews for the Far Horizons Safari (https://farhorizontraders.com/collections/cow-hide/products/safari).\n\nThe bag that initially caught my eye was the Bolt, though it's got less... character than the first two. The Kobe is a cleaner alternative, and probably my least favorite. It's also the one that seems the most subject to manufacturing variance.\n\nAnyone have experience with any of these models? Durability? Customer service? Recommendations for others in the same style, within the same price range?\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nEDITED: to include specification for a separate laptop compartment.",

        "content": "[BIFL] Far Horizon Traders Safari Bag. Up front: The Safari bag is available at http://farhorizontraders.com/products/safari. FHT didn't give me anything to post here (this is my first review of any sort ever) but I just really appreciate this bag and thought others might as well. It seems the only FHT reviews are about the smell of the camel bags (which is a separate issue altogether) but this one is plain jane cow leather...\n\nOkay!\n\nThis is my first \"real\" bag. I've owned a couple LL Bean messenger bags and more recently a Timbuk2 Command messenger bag. I really liked the command - I thought it looked really sharp and had tons of pockets - but I wanted something leather that could hold a 15\" laptop and a bunch of books. Right now I work as a chemist, but I'll be starting law school soon, and I basically always have my laptop, iPad Pro 9.7\", my lunch, some notebooks for patent bar review, and a book I'm reading (currently The Colonel by Richard Norton Smith, cannot recommend enough!). But it's a lot of stuff, and this bag handles it all very well.\n\n---\nPhotos: http://imgur.com/a/CERxN\n\n---\nPros:\n\n* Lots of space. There are 3 internal sleeves (you can see I use them for pens, external HDDs, etc), 2 main interior pockets, one zippered pocket in the back of the interior, one external sleeve (my favorite part) and two enclosures on either side (I put my phone in one, and wallet and keys in the other).\n\n* Looks great. It's not a small bag, but it never looks massive, and I get a number of compliments on it, or questions as to where I bought it.\n\n* Durability. Sometimes I'm carrying quite a lot, and I've never once felt as if it's going to break in any way. A lot of people buy the cheap \"leather\" messenger bags on Amazon (though probably not on this sub!) and if you know about them, you know they snap, they rip, they break.... Not this guy.\n\n* The handle. This is a minor thing but wow... the handle just feels so sturdy, unlike anything I found from L.L. Bean or Timbuk2. I find myself carrying it that way just because I appreciate how well constructed it is.\nCustomer Service. Holy cow. Have you ever emailed Matt? If he doesn't respond within 15 minutes, it's probably because he's asleep. Insanely helpful guy, and a great reason to look into FHT.\n\n\nCons:\n\n* The rear laptop compartment fits a 15\" laptop with a hardshell case (I don't use one) but if you want to put a sleeve on the laptop, I don't think you'll be able to zipper it closed. Not the end of the world, but of note. I was worried that the zipper would scratch the laptop, but so far my 15\" Macbook Pro is clear of scratches.\n\n* The strap came too long for me (5'9\") even on the smallest settings. I used some tools in our chem lab and made two new holes, which make it perfect.\n\n* When the straps are undone, you can only pick it up by the shoulder strap, not the handle. I don't know how you get around that in engineering, but... it is a minor inconvenience.\n\n---\n\nOkay! So those are my thoughts. Feel free to ask any questions or send me photo requests. It's a fantastic bag, and I can't wait to test it out in law school. Now... back to work!\n\nThanks guys.",

One of the characters was carrying a Duluth Safari Duffel (mini or small, I cant tell), and its seems really cool. Duluth advertises the duffel as the ultimate basic travel duffel you can take anywhere, even on a safari etc. I have seen many companies offer canvas duffels with a similar purpose. Most of them are half as expensive as the Duluth Safari. My understanding is that Duluth is high quality but I have never owned their products and cannot confirm. Sadly there are no video reviews for this product on Youtube. Anyone know if this duffel is genuinely rugged enough to be worth $200+.",

My dad likes carrying things with him wherever he goes and almost always wears a vest to hold all of his stuff in.  I think he's had it since the 1980's or 1990's and it is finally starting to come apart in multiple places.  It has two giant pockets in front on the bottom, side hand pockets behind them, two slightly smaller pockets above them, and a few other pockets higher up and on the inside.  I'd like to buy him a new vest to replace it with, but it will need to be fairly durable.  I am looking for the same style, the material should be cotton, canvas, or some other durable fabric.  It does not need to be breathable, insulated, or waterproof, and it should have a very good zipper in front.  He likes having at least one zippered pocket, but that may not be a requirement.  I found some vests that look similar and I was wondering what people's thoughts were on them.

        "content": "[Request] Wide brim (4 to 6+ inch) synthetic packable hats to keep sun off face and neck. The best I have been able to find is this one for $16.99:\n\n* [AmazonSmile: Sun Hat for Men Women, 6\" Brim Sun Protection Outdoor Bucket Cap, Unisex Beach Fishing Golf Safari Waterproof Breathable Packable Boonie Hat at Amazon Men\u2019s Clothing store](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07P6HV43N/)\n\nIt's big enough, but I'm skeptical of the quality. I found the Tilley LTM2 for $80:\n\n* [AIRFLO\u00ae Hat | Tilley](https://www.tilley.com/us_en/ltm2-airflo-hat.html)\n\nIt advertises itself with this:\n\n> \"Serious about sun protection? Our broadest brim AIRFLO\u00ae Hat overshadows the rest\u2026literally. \n\nWell, the brim is only 3.5 inches, which isn't any better than the cheap ones I normally can find anywhere in the world any time I want one. That's not going to work for someone who cares more about effectiveness than fashion. I'm considering getting 2 hats, if necessary:\n\n1. A hat with a wide brim around 4 to 5 inches when the sun is high and I want to avoid the stares from wearing a UFO at a shopping mall,\n2. A hat with a wide brim 6 or more inches when the sun is low and UFO's are already everywhere anyway. This is the hat I really want and prefer, more than the one above.\n\nIt must be foldable so I can pack the hats away when I'm not impersonating The Three Amigos. I dislike hats that fail to block the sun because they have holes in them for ventilation. I'm not completely bald, so it's not super critical, but effective sun blocking is much more important than ventilation. \n\nI prefer a neutral light gray color over other common colors like khaki or beige. I would consider darker colors like black or blue, but I prefer to avoid looking like I'm in the military or on a safari.\n\nIf it didn't need to be packable, I would consider all the enormous stiff hats that were designed in a time when people cared more about sun protection than beach selfies. I realize it's a challenge to make a big hat with a wide brim that doesn't flop down under their own weight like Dumbo ears, but I suppose that explains why modern gigantic synthetic hats don't weight 3 kilos anymore. That said, I could consider a hat made of non-synthetic materials that are still packable, like leather, especially if it's fashionable enough I won't want another smaller hat. \n\nI suppose if it's sufficiently fashionable such that I'm never afraid to wear it, it's less important for it to be packable, but it still needs to be able to survive getting brutally crushed in a bag, indelicately cleaned, etc, and I'm unlikely to select a hat that's fragile (like straw or felt). That's why I'm not using a sombrero or a Southeast Asian cone hat.\n\nThanks for the help reddit!\n\nEDIT:\n\nI found a hat somebody made for a Cad Bane costume, it would be nice if it were commercially available:\n\n* http://i34.tinypic.com/2i7tvo4.jpg\n* [Want to make a Cad Bane costume: where do I start? | Jedi Council Forums](https://boards.theforce.net/threads/want-to-make-a-cad-bane-costume-where-do-i-start.30289089/)",

Now Tata will face seriously competition from new Creta,Mg, Haval,citroen,new Jeep compass,xuv 500.\nIf Tata is considering few more upgrade then harrier will be non beatable in below 20 lakhs segment.\n1. Rear disc brakes\n2. 10 inch infortaintment system with 360 degree camera.\n3. Optional 4x4 system.\n4.paddel shifters.\n5. Internet connectivity.\n6. Standard black colour option.\n7.electric operated boot.\n8.19 inch alloys.\n9. GNCAP rating \n10. Automatic petrol engine.\n11. 5 year unlimited warranty ( even newbie Chinese company MG is giving 5 year road assistance and warranty)\n12. Must improve Tata sales and service experience ( that is the real fear factor among customers, it was always hit or miss)\nif Tata do consider little more upgradation in Harrier then it Will be an real  kickass  SUV in this segment.hope TATAMO is listening \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f.",

Safari had accident when driving at 162 kmph at an Expressway in India had accident with a stray cattle. \nWhole family of 5 people were completely safe, not even a single scratch. Car didn't even roll ever, it's second stage braking was activated(automatically) right after accident. It was a head on collision. In body shop after inspection, I came to know over all frame structure of the car was well maintained, no deformation or even crack. After 2 months, same Safari was back on the road with new engine (as it was under warranty & end to end full insurance) , new radiator & other parts of the front end. \nTherefore, I don't say this car is efficient by engine power but the kind of price you pay, u get the real value of robustness & strong build quality.",

The same applies to the XEV 9E \u2014 the best features and performance are reserved for the top-spec variant, which is priced around \u20b932L ex-showroom. I expect the top variant of the Harrier EV to fall in a similar price range.\n\nWhat I really liked about the XEV 9E is its semi-active suspension system. It adapts based on the selected drive mode, offering excellent ride comfort with minimal body roll. In contrast, when I drove the regular Harrier, I noticed considerable body roll and wasn\u2019t impressed with the steering feedback.\n\nAlso, based on my experience, Mahindra\u2019s after-sales service is better than Tata\u2019s. While the Harrier EV may look impressive on paper, real-world performance and experience can differ. It\u2019s definitely worth test-driving both vehicles before making a decision.",

Bigger is not always better... Now that the prices have been revealed, there is a whopping 3.5 lakhs difference between the top ends, clearly Harrier wins. Some people are talking about battery differences, and guy's it's just 4 Kwh, and it depends on the engine tuning, the range may vary.\n\nTata has been manufacturing EVs since 2019, and they have a good track record. Between Mahindra XUV 400 EV is a disaster. \n\nAbout the charging speeds! It's 5 minues difference, and 98% of the charging stations in India don't support 180 kw charging speeds. 50% are 24 - 30kw only remaining are below 120kw. Harrier has a UPI-based in-car payment system as well, which will be very useful.\n\nHarrier EV base variant and base + 1 variant has all the essential features and it offers 65 Kw batters not like Mahindra that offers only 59 Kw for the base and forces it's customers to buy the top-end variant!\n\nDriver drowsiness alert is also there in Harrier Ev from the base variant as a standard safety feature. XEV 9e adaptable suspension is only reserved for top variants whereas Harriers' new Independent multi-link rear suspension with frequency-dependent damping is available for all variants\n\nI'm booking Harrier Adventure S, which is a value for money variant that has a panoramic sun roof that actually opens!",

And even sitting in the back with the driving seat adjusted for my own comfort, there is no problem. Enough leg room. The vehicle in QWD version is excellent VFM. And it MOVES! The paddle shift regen controls are a joy. The Frequency Selective Dampers and suspension tuning are phenomenal - an excellent, planted ride. Takes curves very well because of its lowered centre of gravity because the battery is nice and weighted below. I love its Discovery Sport inspired kind of aesthetics. To me, Harrier EV is more appealing than the over designed Mahindra EV Twins. The two places it lacks are under thigh support and lumbar support. We have to see how the servicing is. And the software updates and all that. The 75 KWH Battery and real life 528km range should easily take one touring long distance too!",

After we bought this, one of our family friends took a ride and instantly fell in love.\n\nThey ended up ordering a Dark edition Safari as well. We recently lost the beloved car to floods in our area and it's almost guaranteed that we'll get another Safari again. We're just waiting for the Sierra to come out and if it can match the space of the Safari, that might be the option to go for, otherwise it's right back to the Safari. They've gotten so much right with the car that it's hard to fault anything. I know people might prefer the XUV over this, but drive both back to back and I'll tell you, if you're looking for an overall package, the Safari is it.",

Headlight throw on highways...ok for city and hill area.\n\nPros- Drive pleasure although not that torqy but transmission is smooth specially AT version.\nSuspension tuning is very good only con is the tyre profile on top variant with 19 inch alloys as the profile is pretty low so most of the bad road patches can be felt direct but the suspension travel is good.",

        "content": "Few points - Safari 2024 Acc+ AT owner here with over 11k now in over a year -\n1) 360 camera is best in segment - the main rival is XUV700 which is laggy and low res in comparison, speaking from experience. In Safari its slick, great details as well and works consistently, makes handling tight parking and even low speed maneuvers easy , try the brakes in 3D mode in the 360 interface and the car thumbail shows this as well. Great attention to detail.\n2) Safari doesn't have Lane Change Assist - this only comes in the new Mahindra EVs, no Tata car as of date has it.\n3) Safari Facelift didn't have LKA (Lane Keep Assist) on launch (Oct 2023), this came as a SW update in Nov/Dec 2024, prior to the update the LKA button would say what you're seeing \"this feature will be available shortly\" - so this is what you're seeing, once the SW is updated it works seamlessly, no niggles. It doesn't go wonky like you say it does and work/not work sometimes. It works as expected and advertised, period.\n4) SW bugs - the initial software 12.x was buggy, however since 14.x service and now on 15.x - the only bugs i see is the loud Blind Spot Alert sound which starts very loud and then falls into place and the sound duck where there is no voice readout/beep. Very rarely (seen it 3 times in 1+ year) the tpms throws some error which goes away on its own. 95 percent of the times it works without any niggles.\n5) When using paddle shifters, it goes into sport mode and that's the only mode it can be used in - if you dont use the paddles it'll revert back to the city mode, this is the standard behaviour. This is exactly what happened during the video as well when it gave the City mode readout, its normal.\n6) ADAS Features - Well tuned for indian conditions, hasn't given me any issues, behaviour is consistent and predictable. The AEB/FCW is a must have feature in every car as it'll slam the brakes ensuring one slows down considerably in the event of a collision and might fully prevent one as well.",

Still using an old Fiat engine. Harrier's chassis is borrowed from Old Landrover discovery, Engine from Fiat and Gearbox from Hyundai and yet even after combining them they  managed to make the whole engine-gearbox combo unreliable. \n\nI think Mahindra is doing a far far better job, again not perfect, and still a long way to go, but their Engineering is doing a better job. I test drove Thar Roxx one day, and was surprized to see how smooth and punchy that diesel engine was. Even the craftmanship on Mahindra car appears better than TATAs. \nCurvv for example is just a Nexon from inside. And the steering itself feels poorly made. Pressing on horn itself is so frustrating. \n\nAnd even on Curvv, TATA simply couldn't bring 1.5L Turbo petrol, so they brought 2 1.2L Turbos. seriously, and they are extracting around 1.5L more on just adding the GDI on their existing 1.2. And even on the features front they throw everything at you but most of them doesn't work. \nLED light bar, most of the time malfunctions. Even the lighting is uneven. \nTouch screen misfires occasionally \nThe sport mode, at least in Curvv which I test drove, I didn't felt any difference. \nSteering, vague, I think Hyundai group steering is far better than TATA now. \nPaddle shifters are just useless here, many times i tried downshifting, but all I got the message on Gear change denied. \n\nI am not trying to bash them irrationally, but they need to up their game. They need to innovate more.",

        "content": "No doubt Safari is a very good product - naam hi kaafi hai. But honestly XUV700 is the best SUV in this price range - power, smoothness, over-all better interior, and feels better built. It sticks to the highways, shows long legs at triple digit speeds and beats Germans which are above its segment. Safari should have been different from Harrier. Should have had 4wd option + rear wheel driven to really give it the fortuner / scorpio feel. Plus service centers are poor , they have a general chalta hai attitude which is not suitable for today's day and age with so many options and high service orientation from companies.",

        "content": "Any for profit business doesn't kill its cash cows. If a product gets discontinued that means it wasn't bringing them enough profits to justify its existence. It's a pretty simple logic; but seems too hard for the folks who keep complaining about the lack of a RWD and 4x4 Safari. The cost of R&D, new assembly line as well as added complexity to the supply chain to convert the whole lineup or even add the RWD and 4x4 options probably doesn't add up. Would you do it if you were already making bank with FWD models? \n\nThe OG Safari and Hexa got axed because people weren't buying them. I'm not the target customer for RWD or 4x4 vehicles, but I'd have loved to own a Tata nano, especially an electric one. But no point in lamenting about the demise of a product once we collectively vote for its demise by not buying it, eh? \n\nWe don't get the products we want because we ourselves signal to the companies that we don't deserve them. It's kind of unrelated to this topic, but the monumentally stupid policies of our government (sub 4m mongrel automobiles, anyone?) and the eye-watering taxes aren't helping the cause either.",

No XUV 700 can match the visual appeal of new gen Safari. \n\nNeither no Safari can match the utility or core off-road ability of a Scorpio N. \n\nYou ask yourself first which is your purpose?

It's already 5th year since Storme was discontinued and looking at their future strategy at present, it would have taken at least 10 years, if at all, for reintroduction of a beast boasting that kind of prowess.

For parking, I first put it on N, then engage the handbrake and then press N. I did not get this issue as you mentioned.\n2) Software issues - Initially I did face some glitches but after Software updates at Tata Service centre it was resolved.\n3) Glitches in Apple Car Play / Android Auto - I do get these disconnects, but I have observed that my phone gets hotter when using Apple Car Play. To cool my device, I keep my phone in the cooled area under the arm rest. This will ensure that device is cooler and disconnects don't happen. I did drive for almost 320kms at a stretch, but did not get this issue.\n4) Brakes are good, I do drive most of the times in the City and I have managed to stop the car because of some idiots appearing out of nowhere in the road.",

So overall a great experience. The key and all is just a gimmick, dunno why the owner is so dissapointed because of a key \ud83d\ude02 its just a car, switch on and off is good enough, the key seems good and dont see the need for an upgrade",

As it is, diesel vehicles become unusable in the NCR and elsewhere after 10 years, which sucks. So as long as my vehicle is not polluting, I should have the right to drive it. Right? \nLooking forward to some valuable inputs so I might finally buy the new Harrier.\nThank you.",

        "content": "Virtus 1.0 Topline AT vs XUV700 AX5 P. I am planning to buy my first car and have test-driven the following options within a budget of around 20 lakhs. I would appreciate some expert advice on which one to choose:\n\nXUV700 Petrol AX5: I personally like this car, but I'm concerned about its fuel consumption. Various forums mention that it gives about 6-8 kmpl in the city and 10-12 kmpl on highways. Can any current owners validate these numbers?\n\nVirtus 1.0 Topline: I am leaning towards this car since the 1.0 TSI is a turbocharged engine that reportedly offers 12-14 kmpl in the city and 18-21 kmpl on the highway after a run of 3,000 km. Virtus owners, can you confirm these figures?\n\nInitially, I considered the Virtus 1.5 GT, but I read on several forums that the DSG transmission isn't as reliable as a torque converter, so I decided against it.\n\nMy requirements are:\n\nDaily office commute within Noida (40 km round trip)\nGood after-sales service in the NCR region\nLow maintenance costs\nHigh safety standards\nModerate off-roading capabilities for trips to places like Shimla, Kufri, Manali, and Leh\nA reliable car (both VW and Mahindra are known for reliability)\nGiven these criteria, which car should I choose? I have test-driven both and am currently undecided.\n\nThank you for your help!",

        "content": "Fu*k Cancer . Idk how to frame this or to post this i am just writing it, I'll cut the emotions and keep it rational, so I 18M have found myself along with my family of 4 in a very unfortunate situation, well soon to be 3 as docs losing hopes for my father. We are based in Pimpri-Chinchwad,  So at the dawn of last year my father[46] was diagnosed with Blood Cancer, specifically AML in Deenanath Mangeshkar Hospital. He was cancer-free after a few months as it was detected very early. We got his Bone Marrow Transplant [BMT] done, and his brother's match of bone marrow was only 70%, so to get that to 100% we had to do a procedure that was well over 25L. Post BMT he was getting back to normal even to his 9to5 job which he lived for. But again a few months back we saw a spike in WBCs and it was a mutation in AML, now last to last week we tried to give him a very high dose of chemo (FLAG and CLAG) which literally kills every possible thing, the doc also told us this could lead in a very bad as he also has a history of cardiac disease with 1 angioplasty done but we had literally no other option left everything was tried, everything. So one day into it, we landed in ICU terminating the chemotherapy of 5 days, getting diagnosed with pneumonia and infrants in the brain. \n\nHe is a financially sound man and had savings of around 50L. He has a good-paying job of ~50L PA. Which was brought down ~35L last year after his treatment was going on, he was still working and attending phone calls even after there was no need to, that's how much passion he has.\n\nWe have a home loan of idk how many years left but emi being ~25k, a 1700sqft in Pimpri-Chinchwad. A car loan, EMI of ~50k which was being paid by his company but he owns it, idk how he did but did that, the car is an XUV700 AXL. We fully own a Ciaz zxi driven 1.4L km. \n\nAbout his term insurance he has a 1.5Cr cover, idk if there are any savings left, he had ~20L invested in MF, me and my brothers'(M15) education policy of ~25L combined. We sold our paternal grandparent's house earlier this month(they passed away around 2018 both of them) which brought ~12L named after my father.\n\nMy father has two brothers both well-off based in Pune. My mother has two brothers both well-off based in Pimpri-Chinchwad. My maternal grandparents are well-off based in Dehu Road earlier in Kothrud.\n\nI am keeping my hopes high but also being prepared for the worst.

Because he had parked In a no parking zone (parking is just right behind where he parked but he would have to leave his car and pick us up) and the police came and hit the car with stick and took 500rs Challan. Also he came by XUV700 and he really loves this car, it's his prized possession. For 500rs hr abused me and screamed on me. On top of that for I got rank 3 in test and he was screaming at me for that. I couldn't even cry as boys don't cry. I want to die right now",

After finishing my workout I went back and saw 2 men backing out their cars out of the street. One of them saw me and asked if the scooty belonged to me. So I said yes and he just jumped at me. Starting trash talking like \"agar dubara is gali me park kia to activa tod dunga orr jane bhi nahi dunga. Hum is gali ke malik hain\" (dare you park your scooty again here and I'll break it. I own the street). And second guy comes up and says we've confronted the gym guys multiple times and they never listen. \"Gym walo ka dimag ghutno ke hota hai\"(gym guy's brains are in their knees)he said. And ofcourse I was a bit afraid that he might attack me or something. So I just said sorry. They stopped backing up their car and made me wait a few minutes which I couldn't do anything about. After 5 minutes or so I left. The guy who threatened me had an xuv700 and other one had an ertiga(not sure).\n\nTL;DR:\nMy gym\u2019s parking isn\u2019t ready yet, so I parked my scooty in a nearby street. After my workout, two aggressive men confronted me, claiming they \"owned the street\" and threatened to damage my scooty if I parked there again. One insulted gym people in general, and though I felt threatened, I just apologized and waited as they delayed leaving. Eventually, I left without further issue",

But now, I\u2019m stuck in a dilemma, and I need some advice!\n\n# My Situation:\n\n* **Current Family Size**: 4 members (unmarried)\n* **Future Plan**: Might go up to 5 members after marriage\n* **Driving Needs**: Max \\~500 km/month, city driving\n* **Budget**: Harrier (\u20b922.5L on-road) vs. Safari (\u20b923L on-road)\n* **Preferences**:\n   * I like the **Harrier\u2019s looks and feel** better.\n   * Safari doesn\u2019t appeal to me visually (is that just me, or do others feel the same?).\n\n# What\u2019s Holding Me Back?\n\n* The **Safari deal**: For just \u20b950,000 more, I get a **7-seater** instead of a 5-seater. Even though I don\u2019t need a 7-seater *right now*, it feels like a better value-for-money option for occasional group trips or emergencies.\n* **Boot Space**:\n   * Harrier already has good boot space for a 5-seater.\n   * Safari could offer similar practicality by folding down the rear seats when the 7-seater isn\u2019t needed.\n\n# Concerns:\n\n1. **Looks**: I find the Harrier more appealing than the Safari. Does anyone else agree, or am I overthinking?\n2. **Utility**: None of my friends own a 7-seater, so having one could make me \u201cthat guy\u201d everyone calls for group outings. Still, how often would I really need that extra seating?\n3. **Same Engine**: Both cars share the same engine, mileage, pickup, and comfort, so there\u2019s no mechanical advantage to choosing one over the other.\n\n# TL;DR:\n\nAm I being irrational for leaning towards the Harrier just because of its looks, even though the Safari offers more versatility for just \u20b950,000 extra? Or is the Harrier the better choice given my preferences and current needs?\n\nI\u2019d love to hear your thoughts!",

I read on the Internet and could not find that it is included or not. Please do help me out if it will be replaced in warranty or not and anyone who has gone through the same problem.

Manual transmission would be too much effort in city traffic so going for an automatic.I have narrowed down the choices to Mahindra 3XO AX5L Automatic (12.25 lakhs ex-showroom after discount and GST reduction) and Skoda Slavia Sportline 1.5 DSG Petrol (15.3 lakhs ex-showroom after discount and GST reduction). 3XO is a proper 5 seater for adults but with limited bootspace, Slavia has better bootspace but is comfortable for 4 adults and a kid.\n\nAfter the GST cut, diesel Automatic variants of Scorpio N, XUV700, Tata Safari with 6 airbags and other necessary features are available within 18L ex-showroom post discount, which I have the budget for. They supposedly give 12-13 kmpl in city, 18-20 kmpl on highways. They offer a lot of rear seat space as well as boot space when you are not using the 3rd row. Thinking about using it as a 5 seater most of the time which can accommodate more people if required, like extended family visiting. Thinking about Diesel so the mileage isn't bad for a big car. \n\nI would be using the car for office travel in Bangalore's bumper to bumper traffic twice or thrice a week. Will be going out on weekends with family but in the city itself. Will be travelling with family on occasional long trips (within 500 KMs mostly).",

It's average is mostly 20+ in city and 35 on highway. My daily running is 40-50km per day. Budget max is 22-23 preferably 17-18 if possible.\n\nNeed a bigger and premium car due to:\n\n1. Automatic as manual puts pressure on knees in city driving.\n\n2. WagonR bad image. Need a better suv.\n\n3. Status symbol. I am from upper middle class family.\n\n4. I keep going on dates and have to park my car at a distance\n\nCars in mind:\n\n1. Xuv700\n\n2. Thar roxx\n\n3. Scorpio N\n\n4. Elevate\n\n5. Hyryder\n\n6. Harrier\n\nI did not fit in nexon, so that segment is out.\n\nConfusion points:\n\n1. Which segment should I go for? Usually it's me driving alone but once in a month, my family also comes along like my sister and her kids, mom and dad. So basically 5 max.\n2. My previous choice was xuv700 but it gives shitty mileage of 5-6. Same with scorpio N. I know it though my friends who are crying over mileage in petrol manual and automatic. Should I give up petrol and go for diesel?\n\n3. I went to mahindra showrooms today and they are offering 1.18lac off discount if I buy before sep 21. Why would they offer such discount and why should I not wait till sep 22 and avail gst benefits?\n\n4. Will there be any festive discounts in addition to these gst discounts?\n\n5. Should I sell out WagonR? Or keep this small car for city running?\n\n6. Which car is safe, has good features, looks premium and is good for both city and highway along with being comfortable?\n\nSorry for the long post but my friends keep saying u r the most confused person ever. Lol. But I wanna buy a suv within a month now. Thank you guys.",

Can any current owners validate these numbers?\n\nVirtus 1.0 Topline: I am leaning towards this car since the 1.0 TSI is a turbocharged engine that reportedly offers 12-14 kmpl in the city and 18-21 kmpl on the highway after a run of 3,000 km. Virtus owners, can you confirm these figures?\n\nInitially, I considered the Virtus 1.5 GT, but I read on several forums that the DSG transmission isn't as reliable as a torque converter, so I decided against it.\n\nMy requirements are:\n\nDaily office commute within Noida (40 km round trip)\nGood after-sales service in the NCR region\nLow maintenance costs\nHigh safety standards\nModerate off-roading capabilities for trips to places like Shimla, Kufri, Manali, and Leh\nA reliable car (both VW and Mahindra are known for reliability)\nGiven these criteria, which car should I choose? I have test-driven both and am currently undecided.\n\nThank you for your help!",

I might be asking a question which is answered in bits and pieces in multiple forums by different people. \nI did a test drive of Tucson AWD.. the deisel engine and the instant torque felt very good to me.. steering feedback and ride quality is balanced. \n\nI didn't take Tiguan but had a test drive of xuv700 petrol which has similar or better specs atleast on paper... still Tucson was more fun to drive experience for me..\n\nThe confusion I have is about Tucson build quality.. I feel the door thud and everything is good.. also the story of Latin N cap rating, is it true that they reduced rating because of some seatbelt or some button not available and ISOFIX points position but the stability of the vehicle is good.. or just PR. Please share if you know it.\n\nAlso on the Tiguan side.. are German cars really that great and fun to drive.. or is it just car enthusiasts hyping up like som Indian YouTube channels hype up everything from Mahindra.\n\nI want to have good reliable car for 80% of city drive very rare mountains or light off road.. \n\ni have asked an advice previously for car suggestions around 40 lakhs.. and these 2 are shortlisted. \n\nI recently started driving cars just 4 years ago.. did not enjoy the engine revving full yet, so don't want to go for an ev now.. doesn't matter what crazy features they offer.. i did test drive 2 evs but they are not for me.. I like to hear the engine revving when I step on accelerator. So, please don't recommend evs.\n\nI don't want fortuner, I will use this car for 5 to 6 years.. not concerned about reliability and resale. Need one fun and easy to drive car with comfort.",

So, apart from the AX7L variant, all other variants do not get sequential turn indicators. Instead of putting in a static LED strip what Mahindra has done is completely removed any lighting from that part, which makes the indicators really small.\n\nIn my opinion it's a bad place for cost cutting. It will be difficult for the drivers behind these cars and people might miss it during rush hours especially in the crazy traffic hours.\n\nLink to thread: https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/road-safety/262068-mahindra-xuv700s-tiny-rear-turn-indicators-these-safe-enough-2.html",

They checked as per all the parameters. A detailed report was made and since I had extended warranty they agreed to change it in warranty ( previous service centre denied that it will not be covered in warranty). It took about 9-10 days for the tank to arrive and finally today I got it changed.\nI have to pay for the def as the def in the old tank cannot be used in this and some of the bolts. Overall I am relieved a lot now . I checked the mrp on the box it says 21200 for the tank.",

        "content": "Should I buy a used XUV700?. Hi everyone, I was recently browsing through the available used cars on olx and found 2 dealers that have 2 \"decent\" XUV700's for sale. Kind of confused whether it is a good idea to consider them and would like to know your thoughts on this.\n\nSome context, I was looking to buy a brand new XUV700 (AWD AX7L AT) but decided to check the used car market and saw 2 good ones (~50% savings) so considering to check them out.\n\n1. 2022 AWD AX7L Diesel AT\n\nThis has run ~40k kms and looks to be in good condition. Funny enough, this is the exact spec that I was thinking of buying the new one (silver AWD AX7L AT) and I am really tempted to check it out. The asking price is 17.5lakhs though it's negotiable.\n\n2. 2022 AX7L Petrol AT\n\nThis has run 22k kms and looks to be in even better condition than the above one. I am okay it being a petrol. The only reason I was going to go with the Diesel (if I buy a new one) was AWD. I am actually more inclined towards the petrol. Asking price is 16.5lakhs and it's also negotiable. Given that the price is quite good, I am willing to overlook the fact that this would be a FWD.\n\nI am planning to check these 2 out tomorrow and if things go well will probably also get it checked by a mechanic (open to suggestions, I am in Guwahati).\n\nLet me know what you guys think and any potential things that I should be in the lookout for. I have already spent some time to go through the team bhp guide on checking an used car and I feel like I am fairly confident on checking them out.\n\nAlso, for both the cars, I asked what is the reason for selling. The 1st one said they don't know (they are a dealer) and the second one said that the owner bought a 4x4 scorpio n (which sounds very reasonable).",

There was something premuim about it back then, which is still there to this day. \n\nFor me hector was a car for rich corporates and good buisnessmen, which is something xuv700 and harrier can not be. This is just my opinion, but a see a lot of chapri people getting the 700, harrier safari etc. but the hector still maintains a class to this day.\n\nI've had quite a few rides in one that belongs to my friend, and the cabin is amazing. Ride quality is good for city and nvh level is low.\n\nThe only major con is it's mileage\ud83d\ude2d",

If a vehicle is nearing, I can move left or right. This automatic slowing down is irritating me. I've tried multiple cruise options (high/medium/low), but I'm not getting the same feel I had in my old Creta Cruise.\n\nIs there an option to disable Adaptive Cruise and keep only manual Cruise?",

So I would need your opinions to finalize the deal.\n\nOkay so, My dad is only interested in getting the XUV if it costs around 24Lacs & I've been offered 25.60Lacs(AX7L D-AT) from my local dealership from where we took the test drive & today when exploring other dealership one was ready to try matching the same price and I think he's not very much interested in negotiations further as he said since we're not purchasing any extended warranty or accessories from them but I think he might reduce slightly but we want the price around 24.5Lacs with everything included.\n\nThe thing is I'm meditating on behalf of my dad as he's not very much interested in purchasing this car at this time due to mileage related issues of XUV & as we own Dzire Vdi-2013 which gives around 17-20kmpl & he's currently interested in buying Maruti Victoris but this weird company I guess doesn't offer adas in the top end hybrid specs even we don't like the black interior in top model hybrid so to convince him for XUV700 the quote should atleast be around 24.5Lacs with extended warranty & accessories like (ambient light & auto dimming irvm, footstep & few others) to proceed with.\n\nThe same quote offered from two dealerships is:-\n\nEX:- 2261601\n\nTCS:- 22616\n\nINS:- 83000\n\nRTO:- 250800\n\nNavratri Discount:- 50000\n\nFinal quote comes around:- 25,60,000 \n\n(No extended warranty & accessories included in this)\n\nNow what are your thoughts on this & do tell me how to carry forward the negotiations to try bringing the cost around 24.5L as with this other dealer I was having conversation to bring down cost below 25L by trying RTO discount and to increase the Navratri Discount but still it won't reach that quote which we're interested with everything included.\n\nIf due to further negotiations with this other dealer the price comes down further I'll share the same quote with my local dealership to ask for further discount but need some solid advice to ask for discounts on fresh product.\n\n\nTLDR:- offered a quotation of 25.60Lacs for XUV700 AX7L D-AT, what's your view on this pricing & how can we further increase the discount as our budget is around 24.50Lacs with extended warranty & accessories included.",

        "content": "Bought this beauty home - BMW 2 Series (220i).. I've been looking for a premium car (sedan or a crossover) for a few months and finally bought this pre-owned BMW 2021. Test drove cars like Volvo XC40, BMW X1 and also new cars like Virtus GT, Tiguan, XUV 700, but finally settled with this one and I'm loving it. After driving this one, Virtus GT and Tiguan started to feel like a slow car. \n\nLow ground clearance and headroom is the rear is a bit of a problem, but I knew about it before buying the vehicle, so I\u2019m good. Besides that I already have Hyundai Tucson, so this won't be my only/ primary car.\n\nMany would say why not 320 which is a RWD and more spacious. Well, first of all I couldn't go for the 320d (Diesel) because of 10 years rule in Delhi NCR. For 330i (petrol) version, I had to extend my budget by at least 6 lakhs more. And above all, I like the way 2 series looks. Personally, I find it more sporty and fresh looking than the 320. It is October 2021 registered with 22000 on odometer. Got 1 service package along with the 1.5 years extended warranty.\n\nA special thanks to u/ok_sell_4059. This guy really helped me to make an informed decision. It was like I'm talking to a friend. He never fails to amaze with his immense knowledge about the luxury cars. I bought the car from Spinny Max, but I can't explain how easy your life would be if you would buy a pre-owned car through him. Thanks bud :) P.S. It is not an endorsement, but my honest opinion. Thank you for reading!",

Today while driving I was just testing the manoeuvrability of the car. When I moved the steering wheel left-right in swift motion, some kind of weird noise and vibration came from the steering column. It felt as if the motor is making from sound.\nBut then while moving the steering wheel, I tried to apply brakes as well, then the braking paddle also produced some weird vibration. \n\nHas any else faced the same issue? If yes, what was the reason and what\u2019s the resolution for it.\n\nAlso, would request all other owners to test this out. I hope its not any point of failure which makes driving dangerous with this problem.\n\nUPDATE: I went to dealership and checked in their new Test drive vehicle, it also had the same behaviour. The brake pedal also felt to be vibrating while moving the steering. It is believed to be coming from the ABS system.",

        "content": "Car Suggestions in Kanpur. Hello there, I am planning to purchase a new car this Diwali and was greatly confused between the two most bought cars by Mahindra i.e. the Scorpio N Z8 select diesel MT and the XUV 700 AX7 petrol manual. The price at which both of them are being offered are somewhat same where scropio is costing around 20.75 on road and the xuv tagged at 21.60 on road. This would be my first car, which is making me immensely nervous as to what all I should consider. XUV is offering great interior but the panoramic sunroof is something which is personally not my thing due to various factors. On the other hand the scorpio n offers more or less same features at a lower price.\n\nPlease help me out in choosing, I love the interiors of 700 but the scorpio has a different aesthetic.",

I am in process of finalizing my car and have visited all brand showrooms except the luxury ones.\n\nI can afford any car upto xuv700 but I feel car as a depreciating asset and since my usage is less (like 200km a month) and also I do not enjoy driving much. So I was looking for a compact suv in 10-12 lakh budget\n\nMy experience with showrooms has been terrible. The sales folks will not greet you properly, they will not explain you features of the car from base to top variant, they only display top variant and you don't know what kind of car you are getting.\n\nThey treat you like shit. I liked Grand Vitara and was ready to book the base variant which would cost 13.5 lakhs. The moment I told I want to book base, they started pushing me for next variant for 15.5 lakhs. When I refused, they were not respectful. As if 13.5 lakhs is not real money and the top-up 2 lakhs is the actual money!\n\nAnd never make the mistake of visiting the same showroom twice unless you are going to book on that day. \n\nA person is going to buy 13 lakh worth of car and gets no respect or proper communication. I had same experiences with Tata, Kia and Mahindra showrooms also.\n\nIs this some kind of marketing tactic or car showroom people are just too arrogant with booming sales.",

        "content": "Bangalore is getting grid-locked in cars parked on the road. When we say encroachment, most people think of poor shanties (and rich bungalows) on lake beds. But there is a far more dangerous encroachment on that's going unpunished. It is the rich who are encroaching our roads with parking.\n\nIn the last few months, the number of people deciding that they have a right to park on the road outside their homes has increased dramatically. Look at areas in Indiranagar, New Tippasandra and Koramangala, and you'll see that most roads have become single file because people park outside their homes. Are their vehicles blocking traffic or causing inconvenience? Who cares? So what if the other half of the road is dug up? People will still park outside their homes and not shift an inch!\n\nI'm not even talking about valet parking in these areas for customers. These are cars that have been parked because there is no parking inside the premises. It's become such a menace that in some areas, we see two lines of vehicles parked on either side. I doubt even ambulances or fire engines can cross some of these roads.\n\nThere should be a special heavy penalty on people parking huge vehicles like Tata Safari, Fortuners, XUV700, Thar, Volvo and Innovas around corners. You can hardly see incoming traffic in turns. If you can spend so much money buying a car, you better have parking inside your premises. \n\nPeople will quickly make an argument about them paying taxes and having a right to this. I pay taxes as well, but I park inside my building within my alloted parking spots. I ask visitors to park in areas where they don't inconvenience others. \n\nEven worse is that after the ruckus around towing in no parking areas, the rich have been emboldened to park anywhere, and pick up quarrels with anyone who questions them. Bangalore Traffic Police seems too stretched to do anything about this. And our political leaders have grand visions about building tunnel roads and flyovers, while letting this go unpunished.\n\nIn a year or so, I foresee that we will all be crawling on all roads because of unpunished parking. Unless these guys are fined now, and heavily, this will just grow. We'll have poeple dying because ambulances and fire engines are not able to get through and children being forced to spend additional hours in school buses because their buses are slowed to a crawl. But who cares? I have money, so I have a right to the road.\n\nOn a sadistic note, we should have a rule that if you park on the roads overnight, any damage to your car is your own responsibility, and will not be covered by insurance.",

Thinking of getting either an XUV700 or an Innova Hycross Hybrid, but a bit confused about whether I really need the AWD version of the XUV700 (diesel). Also any opinion of an Innova Hycross and weather it is good enough to do such areas considering the torque is way less than the petrol XUV700.\n\nI don\u2019t plan on doing any off-roading and will avoid months with extreme weather. I\u2019ve been to Ladakh before, so I know the general condition of the roads \u2013 just not sure if a 2WD will comfortably handle routes like Pangong, Nubra, Tso Moriri, Umling La, etc., without drama.\n\nI live in Delhi, so apart from the Ladakh trip or regions where we have similar kind of roads, it'll mostly be city/highway driving with my parents and my dog. Is AWD(diesel) really required for such trips, or will 2WD be just fine?",

Idk how to frame this or to post this i am just writing it, I'll cut the emotions and keep it rational, so I 18M have found myself along with my family of 4 in a very unfortunate situation, well soon to be 3 as docs losing hopes for my father. We are based in Pimpri-Chinchwad,  So at the dawn of last year my father[46] was diagnosed with Blood Cancer, specifically AML in Deenanath Mangeshkar Hospital. He was cancer-free after a few months as it was detected very early. We got his Bone Marrow Transplant [BMT] done, and his brother's match of bone marrow was only 70%, so to get that to 100% we had to do a procedure that was well over 25L. Post BMT he was getting back to normal even to his 9to5 job which he lived for. But again a few months back we saw a spike in WBCs and it was a mutation in AML, now last to last week we tried to give him a very high dose of chemo (FLAG and CLAG) which literally kills every possible thing, the doc also told us this could lead in a very bad as he also has a history of cardiac disease with 1 angioplasty done but we had literally no other option left everything was tried, everything. So one day into it, we landed in ICU terminating the chemotherapy of 5 days, getting diagnosed with pneumonia and infrants in the brain. \n\nHe is a financially sound man and had savings of around 50L. He has a good-paying job of ~50L PA. Which was brought down ~35L last year after his treatment was going on, he was still working and attending phone calls even after there was no need to, that's how much passion he has.\n\nWe have a home loan of idk how many years left but emi being ~25k, a 1700sqft in Pimpri-Chinchwad. A car loan, EMI of ~50k which was being paid by his company but he owns it, idk how he did but did that, the car is an XUV700 AXL. We fully own a Ciaz zxi driven 1.4L km. \n\nAbout his term insurance he has a 1.5Cr cover, idk if there are any savings left, he had ~20L invested in MF, me and my brothers'(M15) education policy of ~25L combined. We sold our paternal grandparent's house earlier this month(they passed away around 2018 both of them) which brought ~12L named after my father.\n\nMy father has two brothers both well-off based in Pune. My mother has two brothers both well-off based in Pimpri-Chinchwad. My maternal grandparents are well-off based in Dehu Road earlier in Kothrud.\n\nI am keeping my hopes high but also being prepared for the worst. Please suggest anything if you feel if not thank you for listening me. \n\nFUCK CANCER",

MG Hector vs Hyundai Alcatraz | Which one to go for??\n\nWould like to get answers from all on this... \n\nThe below points are my thoughts after taking a long test drive on both vehicles. \n\nBoth models are Petrol Automatic \n\nHECTOR  - (Since we are looking for 5 seater, and non ADAS version)\n* I'm amazed at the spacious and comfortable interiors of the Hector \n* The suspension was great in the Hector and any bumps and potholes on the road were practically not felt at all\n* The engine felt good and responsive.. \n\n* The ADAS felt disappointing since the calibration was not upto the mark\n\n* The infotainment screen does have a niche feel to it, but I felt adding more buttons and knobs could have made it more user friendly\n\n* The in-built maps is from mapmyindia which wasn't showing very accurate results so, now sure if that was just with the test vehicle or broader issue\n\n* The biggest concern I have is the FE, because anyone and everyone I know has mentioned of Hector being a guzzler...now I'm not sure how true that is. But getting only 6-8.kmpl even after 10k kms...seems concerning \n\nNow, onto the next\n\nALCAZAR (7 seater top end, petrol automatic)\n\n* The look of the Alcazar was good and gave a good SUV feel,\n\n* Driving it felt great with all the the functions & features felt quite integrated into the vehicle.\n\n* The screen was visibly smaller compared to Hector, but since other vital controls such as radio, HVAC, and so on have knobs so it dint really make a difference.\n\n* The car did rev louder than the Hector when I switched to Sports mode, but the pick up was better on the Alcazar \n\n* The ADAS was far better synced and calibrated to indian roads and felt genuinely useful while driving compared to Hector, where it felt more of a distraction \n\n* The cabin space felt decent but, since Alcazar doesn't offer 5 seater variants, we were forced to test drive the 6 seater one, and my family doesn't want the captain seats in the second row, so will have to look at the 7 seater \n\n* Providing ventilated seats in the second row was a big plus as the Hector did not have that\n\n* Android Auto and Apple Car Play was available only wired mode and not wireless, which was a let Down, compared to Hector which has wireless \n\n* The wireless charging pad was really well placed and charged uninterrupted, whereas in Hector, the charging kept getting paused even with the vehicle being standstill.\n\n* The FE claims and what I'm hearing is not too bad with 12-14 kmpl being said for the Petrol Auto variant too\n\n* Looking at the 7 seater is a necessity more than a need, so most of the time the last row would be folded down for the boot space\n\n* However, I felt the second row was less spacious compared to the Hector, obviously, the vehicle dimensions matter, but with Alcazar, if the driver seat is pushed back all the way, the person sitting behind was not comfortable \n\n\nWith the onroad price of Alcazar falling just about 26Lac and Hector being 27 lac(non ADAS) I'm not sure which to go with\n\n\nI'd love to know if I've missed anything and if there's anything else that I should also consider",

        "content": "Update on my 2016 S-Cross 1.3 DDIS. Hello! It\u2019s been a while since my last post on this community. The car completed 9 years last week, and the odometer now stands at 228k kms\u2014happily chugging along.\n\nRegarding the AC not working properly, I initially got it serviced, which lasted for only a week, and eventually had to replace the entire AC system. One observation\u2014NVH has reduced noticeably after the AC replacement.\n\nThe tyres were changed to CEAT Securadrive at 222k kms; I got a good deal on Amazon for them. The battery was also replaced, as the old one had weakened over the past two years.\n\nParts for periodic maintenance are on order and will be installed before it hits 230k kms. I also replaced the fog lamp housing with Uno Minda units and upgraded the bulbs to Osram 4300K LEDs. These have helped with visibility at night, though visibility still suffers during rain.\n\nFuel efficiency has dropped to 15 kmpl for some reason\u2014I blame the pending service, especially the overdue EGR cleaning. Despite this, the car still feels fresh and confident, whether it\u2019s a 30 km daily commute or a 500 km temple run.\n\nWe\u2019re still looking to add another car to the garage, as my father and I are currently managing with just the S-Cross. The Alcazar D AT and Hycross VX 8 STR are currently shortlisted, as my father insists on having a 7/8-seater.",

Weekly: One long highway drive (~200+ km). I like comfort and a laid-back cruise with family, but also want some driving pleasure and power on the highways.\n\nThe dilemma:\n- Diesel is said to be a beast, torquey and fun.\n- Petrol I\u2019ve heard is basically Alcazar with better interiors and underpowered. (How true is this?)\n\nBUT I am getting featured in the Petrol top which comes with ADAS, ventilated seats, memory seats etc. Plus I also get resell value. Diesel misses out on all of this.\n\nQuestion is - Is the petrol really that bad, or is it still the one of the best petrol option in the segment?\nWill the diesel give me a noticeably better driving experience for my usage? What about resale/exchange value between petrol vs diesel?\n\nWhat would you pick in my situation?",

Hello All,\n\nI am torn between the decision of purchasing between the two as I am looking for a 6-7 seater petrol car within the range of 25 Lacs.\nThe preference is towards buying a car which has better ground clearance due to Gurgaon's worsening potholes.\nHowever, here are my major points of contention to make the decision - \n1. Mileage - I have a commute of 40Kms via Dwarka Expressway and internal highways. If anyone can suggest me the real world mileage of both cars in peak traffic, cruising between 40-60 in city and on Highways \n2. Features - Alcazar comes packed with all the features that one could want; Are features in Hycross GXO sufficient or is there any particular one that one could definitely miss\n3. Suspension - Which car has better suspension \n4. Leg/Knee space - I feel Alcazar wouldn't be able to fit 6 adults in any case. Real world opinion needed\n\nAt the end, any particular things that I should know of or if there exists any other worthy car within 25-26 \n\nThanks",

I've been on the lookout for an apartment since November and no luck! Each agent has been taking 500 bucks and showing me really shitty apartments. \nNeed a decent apartment close to work. Preferably close to Diamond House, Zero 40, Alcazar Mall. My workplace is on Road #10, Jubilee Hills. Any leads to would be appreciated! \n\nAlso, what do outsiders do for fun here? I do mingle from time to time but it's mostly with locals where it's difficult and exhausting when no one gives a crap about communicating in a language except Telugu \ud83d\ude15\n\nEdit: *Most* people don't care enough to keep me in the conversation. So, I keep to myself and literally get shamed for being anti-social/not putting in effort to want to be part of the conversation. It's not like they don't speak English. Most of the people I've hung out with (out of obligation) are genuinely nice people who take the time out to roughly translate. I don't have an ear for languages, so learning and picking up anything is something I could never do.\n\nI'm not trying to shit on anyone, I'm just saying it would be nice to not feel so left out all the time.",

Dealer (and the manufacturer) want to repair the car and give it back to us, while believe we should be refunded or given a new car as the vehicle we received is clearly faulty and not safe to drive.\n\nPlease help retweet - https://twitter.com/abhishek_ko/status/914092290074914816\n\nWater Leakage Videos - https://youtu.be/oh9kJudBYPs\n\nNonstop Sensor Alarms - https://youtu.be/hv98XEQm9ek\n\nImages - https://imgur.com/a/mkacC\n\n\nHello all,\n\nMy family recently purchased a brand new new petrol Toyota Innova Crysta from Shinrai Toyota in Mumbai in the month of April.  Currently, the car has only driven 1800-2000 KM since purchasing it so it is still in brand new condition.\n\nDuring the past few months we have experienced unbelievable problems with the car and I just wanted to spread the word and let other people know to be wary before they decide to purchase the \u201creliable\u201d Toyota Innova Crysta.\n\nOur problems started when the cheaply made interior plastic door panels broke within the first few weeks. We complained and fought with them and managed to convince them to replace it. The door panels are so poorly made that the paint coating on them is already peeling (Even on the replacement) after just a few months of light use. The leather lining on the passenger door panel also has started to peel out from the seams.\n\nLast month, while driving the car, the trunk open light and indicator started beeping and flashing and wouldn\u2019t turn off even though we repeatedly tried to switch off the car and re-open and close the trunk. There was also some other warning light displayed. We didn\u2019t think much of it at the time, and took the car to the dealer be checked. They claimed that the trunk wasn\u2019t closed properly, and that water may have entered the petrol tank (possibly because the pump we filled it at scammed us according to the CSR Rep at Shinrai - we fill up our tank at Hindustan Petroleum in south Bombay and I highly doubt they are mixing water in their petrol). They \u201cfixed\u201d it and we took the car back. We also noticed some water in the trunk and utility area in the trunk but thought that it might just be spilled water or condensation so we didn\u2019t pursue it further.\n\nThen recently, while driving in the rains, we were lucky to notice that water was actually LEAKING into the car in the trunk area from multiple locations! I documented the leakage and have posted the video links below. The car is leaking from multiple locations, so it is not an isolated issue. Clearly, water is also leaking into the petrol tank as the CSR rep at Shinrai told us that one of the alarm indicators was caused by water in the tank. \n\nHow is it possible that a BRAND NEW Toyota Innova (a hallmark of quality and safety in the industry) managed to get passed quality control if the car is leaking water during rains. The trunk open light continues to sporadically beep and blink for hours at a time (we often drive 2-3 hour distances in the day for work). Im guessing the sensor or electrical wiring is damaged from the water leakage. We\u2019ve also been experiencing a rattling noise which seems to be coming from the front of the car, but we haven\u2019t been able to recreate that to record it on video. We\u2019ve had to drive 2-3 hours at a stretch with this alarm constantly beeping in the background multiple times!\n\nWe contacted the main Toyota-Kirloskar (they are the manufacturers of Toyota in India) office and they sent a representative to talk to us. They claim that nothing is wrong with the car and its just a small problem which they will fix in the dealers service center, and that its a very normal issue. \n\nI refuse to believe that this is a normal issue, I\u2019ve never heard of a brand new car LEAKING WATER during rain. If the factory couldn\u2019t properly test the waterproofing of the car, I find it extremely hard to believe that other critical safety components are thoroughly tested (airbags, brakes, crash-testing, etc). \n\nPlease look at the images and videos I\u2019ve uploaded and help us share this message so that people are wary before they blindly trust a once reputed brand. \n\nImages - https://imgur.com/a/mkacC\n\nWater Leakage Videos - https://youtu.be/oh9kJudBYPs\n\nNonstop Sensor Alarms - https://youtu.be/hv98XEQm9ek",

        "content": "The new 6-lane expressway between Bengaluru and Mysuru is a death trap. I had heard so much about the new 6-lane expressway between Bengaluru and Mysuru. I decided to try it out for myself.\n\n#My experience\n\n1. To start with, the toll booths are constructed. But they are not functional yet.\n2. The maximum speed limit is **100 Kmph**.\n3. There are still 3-4 breaks in the expressway at which 3 lanes of fast moving vehicles merge into one lane. An inexperienced driver may not be able to drop to 20 Kmph from 100 kmph within 5 seconds.\n4. 2 wheelers and autorickshaws are plying on the expressway (something that is disallowed on this expressway).\n5. There are no speed cams to check over-speeding.\n6. During the day time, I was in the middle lane, going at 100 Kmph. In the rearview mirror, I saw a Toyota Fortuner and an Innova bearing down on me. One overtook me from the left and the other overtook me from the right. They were speeding at 120+ Kmph. And this happened multiple times with the same models of cars.\n7. Large trucks were moving slowly on the rightmost and middle lanes (which is meant for the fast moving vehicles)\n8. There are breaks in the expressway to let in vehicles from the nearby town. There ought to be a long curve in the road that merges into the expressway, so that both the drivers can see each other for atleast 150 metres before the roads merge. But the entry from the town into the expressway is very abrupt. I saw a teenager enter the highway on a 2-wheeler. On the expressway, a car was moving at 100 Kmph on the leftmost lane. There was a collision and the teenager died on the spot. And this is not an isolated incident. It is not being reported in the media; because the state government is marketing the idea that the travel time between Bengaluru and Mysuru would be reduced to 90 minutes!\n9. On the way back, I traveled at night. In between there are stretches that have zero lights, no lane markings on the road and no way to distinguish the wall from the road.\n\n#Need of the hour\n\n1. Install speed-detecting cameras all along the expressway.\n2. Provide road lights and lane markers in the full stretch of the expressway.\n3. Automated traffic tickets should be sent to the owners of vehicles who break the traffic rules on this expressway\n**Over-speeding**, **Trucks and other heavy vehicles** wandering away from the left-most lane, **2-wheelers and autorickshaws** entering the expressway (as per rules, they are not allowed on the expressway)\n\n#PS: Drive safe\n##Be predictable to other vehicles. Simple things like:\n1. Stay within the speed limit\n2. indicate when you want to change lanes\n3. use hazard lights and the emergency brake, if you need to slow down suddenly (at a diversion, for example)\n4. overtake only from the right side.\n5. Anticipate rash, rule-breaking driving from all other drivers on the road.\n\nPlease keep this post in mind if you plan to drive between Bengaluru and Mysuru using this 6-lane expressway. You can add comments on your driving experience on this expressway.",

Have you ever thought why the prices of cars in India is obnoxiously high....?!\n\nHave you ever thought why top car manufacturers refuse to launch their globally best selling models in India..?\n\nOnly answer to these questions lies in the\" taxation\" of Automobiles in our country. Brace yourselves for the truth...!!!\n\nLet's take' Toyota Innova crysta ' as an example,\n  Midvariant crysta costs about 26lakhs On road kochi.\n(Ex showroom 19.5 lakhs)\n\n1) In Onroad price Around 5.5 lakh\u20b9 is road tax.\n\n2) 1L \u20b9 Insurance.\n\n3) In ex showroom price 28% gst+ 20% cess imposed by govt sums upto roughly around 9 lakhs. (48% of ex showroom price )\n\nSo, In total when toyota sells a car worth 26 lakhs the sum of total amount they get is only 10.5L\u20b9!!!\n\nIn the name of taxation government takes 14.5 lakhs for a car worth around 11L\u20b9...!!!\n\n( Numbers are only roughly calculated based on the information given to me by Toyota dealers. May vary a bit depending upon the year, make and model of the car)\n\nWhat do you think about this heavy taxation? Our Government still thinks a car is a luxury?\n\nPlease express your opinions down there....",

        "content": "I'm realising that my parents are economically dumb. My dad used to have \u20b93L/month salary in UAE which he left because of his ego. He started his business and failed and lost \u20b950L. He again got a job for 1.5L/month and he left within 1 month because of his boss scolding him. He also didn't upskill this time. He's now jobless and the best offer he could get is \u20b928K in Bangalore without food and rent. \n\nMy mom got a government school history teacher job with a starting salary of \u20b925k but after 5 years, it'll become \u20b950k. But she didn't go, instead decided to be a housewife. I appreciate her deciding to look after us. But she now spents ridiculously on food items, gadgets and clothes despite not having any income. She's also thinking of buying a new Innova Crysta worth \u20b930L when neither my mom nor my dad has any income. They  have decided to sell our land for \u20b930L and buy the car \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\nMy dad didn't do any savings with the few middle eastern money he got. Instead spent it on iPhones, Raybans, Laptops and luxury clothes.\n\nCurrently, they only have a rental income of \u20b930k but have to pay back \u20b915L as loan amount. As a highschooler, I can't seem to do the daily expenses  with the leftover amount. Even my tution teacher scolds me for not paying the tution on time. Keep in mind that the tution amount is only \u20b91500/month. And they can't even pay that amount. \n\nParents are not really worried about financial safety. They say money comes and goes which I think is dumb. A single hospital bill is enough to collapse our family and they don't get it.\n\nMy dad thinks that it's time to enjoy the wealth since he's getting old but he already spent all the wealth he made in the first place buying useless items. \n\nNot being an ungrateful brat, but I think they could have made better decisions and secured our family's financial future. They could have easily saved 2-3 crores for retirement and expenditures provided that my dad had a salary of \u20b93L/month without any expenses in UAE.\n\nNow, they'll have to suffer when they are sick and spent time in a cheap hospital and not afford anything on their death bed with their money alone. I'll have to work hard and get a good job, pay off \u20b95L bachelor's loan, \u20b940L masters abroad loan and also \u20b915L loan my parents took while also maintaining my parent's expenditures, my expenditures, my future family (wife and kids) expenditures. I'm happy to serve them as they did me. I'll happily take care of them. But I regret them not saving enough when they had the means.",

        "content": "Indian Politics: a note on the state of things. I can understand where people who long for one party rule, autocracy, military rule come from - their reasoning is probably along the lines of \"let's skip the drama and get on with things, we have stuff to get done\". There's something about it that feels neat, organized, like a well-oiled, precision-engineered, noiseless, frictionless machine where things will \"just happen\" in perpetuity. \n\nIn practice, however, what ends up happening within any system lacking competition, active tug of war, consequences, accountability, is that a parasitic class of people emerges, gets incentivised, and ends up occupying the power hierarchies. They just latch on and get their offspring to latch on as well. Together, they then suck the taxpayers dry. \n\nThere are no consequences because the taxpayers are not a real voting bloc - yet. And won't be for a few decades if we don't grow fast enough. Therefore it becomes easy to bully them with the threat of jailtime, grab money from them and give it away, buy the votes of gullible idiots under random, mostly impromptu \"schemes\".\n\nWe need a clear definition of what a government is, and is not. Where the role and responsibilities of government (centre, state, local, urban, rural) end, and individual responsibility begins. There needs to be a logic and a thoughtfulness to governance. For example, if support of some sort is required, to whom, for how long? What measurable variables do you want to improve to what extent using this support mechanism, beyond which individuals need to become responsible for their lives? How do you incentivise people to get off the support? And all this has to operate under the larger structure of what is financially sustainable. \n\nBecause we can't continue to operate like an impromptu circus, some baraat. Eventually the ride will end, the music will be over, and the bills will have to be paid - it appears that the MP government might not be in a position to pay the bills after all the fancy Innova Crystas they wanna buy with taxpayer money, even though their existing cars are not that old (bought last year) as per this ToI report. \n\nAll this is pretty party-agnostic. This is the default behaviour and mindset of Indian politicians across party lines, with few exceptions. The larger problem is the mental laziness and indiscipline in the culture in general, which stems perhaps from the lack of a unified moral structure that can bind people together?\n\nEven religion, in theory a useful social tool, gets misapplied - people become religious when it comes to faaltu ka halla and partying and drama, and don't use the pretty rich religious-cultural heritage they pretend to be so proud of to actually reflect upon the various aspects of life and society, and use it as a toolbox, set of ideas for structuring their lives. \n\nI don't mean to alarm people here. We *seem* to be moving in the right direction overall, although the movement is a slow, distracted crawl. Threats, parasitical ideas and people lie aplenty, still.  \n\n\n[https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/mp-govt-in-massive-debt-but-ministers-want-new-cars/articleshow/108806844.cms](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/mp-govt-in-massive-debt-but-ministers-want-new-cars/articleshow/108806844.cms)",

        "content": "I tried to cheer up a Uber driver yesterday. Then this happened.... Yesterday, booked an Uber after a long time. A grumpy driver in a polished Innova came in, and it seemed that he had a fight with his wife early morning. He even had a problem with me opening the window for fresh air, and was consistently poking me for selecting a route that had bad roads.\n\nWhile getting down at the shopping complex, I told him that relax, it will be a good day. He finally gave a little smile.\n\nHad to book another cab after 15 minutes, since the shop was closed. Uber was busy, so booked Ola, and voila! The same Innova came in.\n\nThis time, his smile had broadened a bit, as I teased him like, both Uber and Ola, huh.. smart man you are.\n\nHe then opened up, and said that this was his 1st ride in 9 months, and he got back to back rides from the same customer, in different apps. It was like a good omen, he said, and told that it seems I am lucky for him.\n\nSuddenly, near my home, his Ola app pinged again, and he received a Mumbai outstation trip, with a night allowance of Rs 1200. \n\nHe suddenly stopped the car, turned back, and said seriously, \"Sir, aapko tip dene ka man kar rha hai. Kaise du?\" (Sir, I want to give you tip. How to do it?)\n\nA strange energy was exchanged between us, positive, good vibes were flowing within that car, and I felt that booking a cab can actually change one's destiny.\n\nWe shared some good ol' jokes, and he drove away laughing and cheering from that point on.",

        "content": "Sucks to be treated like a second class citizen in your own country (rant). So I was driving on Delhi - Chandigarh highway yesterday. We were nearing a crossing so the traffic was slow, but moving. I heard a siren coming from behind me and when I checked it appeared to be a police Gypsy with red-blue lights and siren blazing. Although it wasn't an ambulance I didn't mind giving way for important things so I slowed and moved deeper in the left. The police car was followed by an Innova with a fancy number plate. Appeared army or something. Fine, I let it pass too. \n\nNow the third vehicle was an Innova with a usual number plate. I didn't see any reason to give way to the third vehicle and cut in my lane again. He went bonkers and kept honking and drove dangerously close to my vehicle. I thought he's a jackass trying to be in the VIP group that just went ahead so I maintained my lane within the speed and traffic limits. The third car made a crazy overtake manoeuvre, came parallel to me and there were bouncer type guys hanging from both windows screaming at me and signalling me to leave my lane for them.\n\nRemember, it's a normal vehicle with no right of way, not signalling any sort of emergency but is trying to pick a fight at 80kmph on a highway while I'm driving in my lane with my family. And then the next 2 vehicles behind that did the same. For driving in my lane in my vehicle having paid the same road and toll tax (assuming they paid any). I know the best thing to do is just let them pass but it feels so humiliating. It sucks to be treated like a second class citizen despite being an honest taxpayer and a responsible citizen because some entitled asshole's guards think they own the road and won't mind putting everyone else in panic and danger.",

I'm slightly worried so I'll leave out identifying details here.   \n\nI was riding my motorcycle when a white Innova with completely black windows ( illegal ) came horns blaring full speed behind me and almost ran me over. I moved to the side, he cut across in front and got out of his car. As I tried to scoot away this person grabbed me from the neck and tried to pull me off. Luckily I accelerated away quickly. I quickly reported this to the nearest police officers I could find, but they said they couldn't do anything as I didn't get the entire number.   \n\nI'm still scared :(. He was definitely a goon and could've definitely beaten me up ( Damn Buff guy ). Stay safe you guys!   \n\nPS - I don't know what I did to him, seems highly unlikely that I cut him off or something of the sort.",

        "content": "[Serious] How to expose a godman who's running a cult?.  This is my personal story, my family was in this cult for 15 years & some of them are still in it.\n\nSo 15 years back my dad was having some alcohol issues. My dad's brother-in-law suggested we visit his 'guruji'. They were his followers for quite some time & they're from Juhu so were quite well off. The guruji is a homoeopathic doctor (first red flag) & practices in many clinics in Mumbai & Thane.\n\nHis deal is that he claims that he's got enlightenment & can speak to Datta Bhagwan. People come to him for various issues besides health. Marriage problems, property not selling, can't find a partner to marry, family problems, depression, and business problems all are tackled by him. For all these problems he claims to talk to Datta Bhagwan & tells the people to visit some temple & that will solve their problems.\n\nNow keep in mind these temples aren't the typical temple around Mumbai, they're mostly located in South India. Sri Kalahasti, Subramanya, Somnath, Rahu, and Ketu are some of the temples given by him. His main temple is in Gangapur, Karnataka. It's Datta Bhagwan's main place of worship.\n\nComing back to my dad, he was told to visit Gangapur with guruji many times. After going there it helped him out with his alcohol issues so he put his full faith in him & has been taking my family there also & telling everyone who'll listen about the greatness of guruji & the spiritual progress which will happen if you go to Gangapur.\n\nSo with most of the problems that people come for to guruji are ones that get solved eventually with time. What guruji does is he tells the person that they're having this issue because of XYZ planet & their stars aren't correct so they should visit the respective temple to solve their problems.\n\nHe usually tells to make 2-4 trips to these temples depending upon the problem. Now it's very difficult for people who are working or having a business to leave everything & go to these temples. The people who go to him are mostly middle class. So it takes them around 2-3 months to complete all these trips. Problems often resolve within that time & if they don't, guruji just claims that the stars are very bad & you'll have to make more trips.\n\nAnything good that's happening in your life is because you went to these temples & the God's are happy with you. Anything bad happens means you're not doing it with enough faith or he claims that it's this bad because you went to these temples, if you didn't go then it would've been worse.\n\nHe goes to Gangapur almost every weekend with a rented Innova or Tavera. He goes with his wife & sometimes son so he needs to fill his seats in the car so that the contribution per person is less. He'll ask his followers to come with him to Gangapur & they take it as an honour whereas he's just doing it to reduce his cost. Every weekend around 2 cars go to Gangapur.\n\nHe also does trips to temples all across India & does them by car starting from Mumbai. He smokes cigarettes so he always keeps the car non AC. I've travelled so much in those shitty cars for more than 24 hours at a stretch. It was hell. He fits 7 people in a Tavera / Qualis excluding the driver. We made a mattress & plywood the size of the rear seat of the car & we travel often 3 people in the back of the shitty car.\n\nEarlier they were staying in a guest house in Gangapur, later he told his devotees to ask for donations from people for building a math (ashram/guest house with small temples) there. My dad asked everyone he knew for these donations & himself donated a lot & also worked to construct it as he's a civil contractor.\n\nThat sleazy asshole knew my mom's side was rich so he forced my mom to ask her parents to donate.\n\nNow they've built the math there so everyone goes there only. They leave Mumbai on Friday night, reach Gangapur by Saturday morning, rest for the day & usually have havans at night till the morning. The havans were quite normal not some crazy ritual. He frequently tells people to come with their problems to Gangapur as he can't answer them in Mumbai for some reason.\n\nHe isolates you from your friend circle & relatives by saying that if you go & eat from their home, you'll get their bad karma. Don't go to weddings as if they break up in the future, you'll get cursed as you were also a part of it. The only place where you can come to socialize is his dispensary or Gangapur or whatever temple he's going to.\n\nHe has such control over his devotees that they even ask him which car to buy, what mobile to buy, where to go for holidays & the limit of whom they should marry. He just suggests another devotee who's single for their marriage & they do it in Gangapur. His son (he was like my brother till I discovered his father is a con artist) also part of the scam always told me to not tell my friends that I'm going to Gangapur this frequently as he must be aware that someone will take my blinds off.\n\nBut I like my father preached guruji to my close friends. Some of them tried to tell me in a very diplomatic manner that I was being scammed but I didn't take it well. I told them to not dare utter a word about guruji that much was my faith.\n\nEventually, when I was in my smoking up phase in my college hostel, I told those friends also about guruji & his powers. They also tried to tell me I was being robbed showing me examples of Nityananda. I was offended by it & told them 'mera vaala alag hai'. Then one day after I was stoned, I got this sudden realisation that was happening to me & how I was being controlled. Everything made sense & I had a flashback of all the times my friends tried to warn me about him. I broke his rudraksh which was given to me & then decided I'll stop being part of this bullshit.\n\nUnfortunately, this realisation came at a very difficult time in my life. Due to my addiction, I wasn't able to function correctly or even speak coherent sentences, was overthinking as fuck & going in BT. My friends helped me & stood by me all the time but a time came when my condition was so bad that they had to call my parents.\n\nThey told my parents about my addiction & they were shocked to visit my hostel to take me home. At this point, I told them what was happening with us. I showed them a video on Ted-Ed about a cult & paused it to correlate that with what our situation was.\n\nAnother important point, I had started smoking cigarettes & weed because of guruji's son who was my bestie. So I ratted everyone to my parents & told them that when I was going to guruji's place, we were sitting in his son's room & took bong rips. My condition was due to his son. Now I know I should take responsibility for my own actions but at that time I wanted to get my family out of that cult so went with it.\n\nMy mom was very thankful to have me back & she vowed to never go to Gangapur again as it had caused me so much harm. My father & my brother, unfortunately, didn't get convinced & still go to guruji for all the things. My brother even asked guruji what he should do for his birthday! He told him to visit some temple in the south & he did that instead of partying & enjoying his birthday.\n\nI can't understand how such educated people can fall into this trap. Sometimes he literally tells people to kneel & put their head on the floor as we do in temples at a random tile because some god is there & people actually do it!\n\nI want some news agency to expose him for scamming people so that my family & various others can be liberated from his hold. He doesn't have a very big following though. He must be having around 100-200 followers who regularly come to him for advice.\n\nWhat do you guys suggest to expose him? How should I tackle the situation? If I can't take him down, I want to get my family out of it so suggestions are welcome!",

Politicians only working for blaming each other.  There is no sensible approach being taken. What is astounding is the lack of any intelligent media that can write a thoughtful column with any useful suggestions.  The answer that will bring down the pollution level in Delhi drastically is neither CNG taxis or even odd.  Though CNG taxis can be a sensible option in the sub 2000 cc cabs the long run when  we have increased the CNG stations to 3 times of what they are today.  We will still need non CNG BMWs and Mercs to be there as taxis.  And the cars like Innova as well.  Imagine sending a CNG wagon R to pick up the  CEO of a multi national for a conference.  If someone would analyze the pollution data that will see that the most polluted air in Delhi is at 5 am.  And that is because trucks roam the  roads free all night.  There are no norms for these trucks on pollution.  They spend hours on toll plazas and we cannot have RFID tags mandatory for trucks because each state has to check the goods and we cannot pass the GST that will eliminate this. So let the citizens get harassed let's block DND and Gurgaon..  Sorry Gurugram.. If someone could spend more time thinking of fixing issues than in renaming places.  If only our politicians would be able to keep  petty politics aside for a single day and do something that will benefit the people that get fooled year after year by the the promise of democracy !",

        "content": "AAP- Points to Ponder. I was very excited when AAP announced that it would contest the Delhi Assembly polls. Like many of my friends, my first vote also went to AAP jhadu. Jhadu for change. AAP had its way and I was jubilant.\n\nBut the recent trends Ive seen with this party are quite troubling and have left me disillusioned.\n\nIt has been 10 days since they assumed duties and appointed ministers. Not many  promises are  being fulfilled.\n\n1. Porta cabins for the homeless- Just a promise it seems. It's 10th Jan today, winter is at its peak and is exceptionally harsh this year. Not one has been installed. \n\n2. They said power firms would be audited and whatever excesses they were charging would be revised. But instead they chose the easy way- provided subsidy. Now it is a truth that states suck at power distribution and try to keep away from it. Subsidy on power for domestic use is a big no-no globally. USSR collapsed, China learnt it lesson. Delhi's finances will be crippled. Power cuts upto 2hrs have begun occurring frequently in parts of the city. \n\n3. The 700l that was promised reached to only 4L or so families. If anyone bother to look at DJB water tariff rates, they will see that the cost for those 700l daily were very nominal to say the least. [here are the rates mentioned on DJB site](http://www.delhijalboard.nic.in/djbdocs/whats_new/press/releases/calculation%20of%20water%20bill.htm)\nMoreover, out of the 17000000 people in delhi, only 3% will benefit.\n\n4. All AAP members vowed to lead austere lives- in a bid to end the VIP culture- but this was not observed either. They all accepted their swanky Innovas. Remember how they mad enews by travelling in metro on the swearing in day?\n\n5. In a bid to avoid uncomfortable decisions regarding the slums on public land, AAP had promised not one slum will be removed till they are provided with alternate housing. Providing for so many people will never be practical. And the slums will only swell in an unregulated manner. And FYI, most of the slum plots are owned by a few people and they reap all the slum rents. Its another mafia lurking in there.\n\n6. AAP is yet to make a manifesto regarding anything apart from corruption. But it has decided on pushing for more reservations based on caste and gender. [Link to Econ Times](http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2014-01-06/news/45918537_1_aap-aam-aadmi-party-additional-quota) This seems bad, atleast to me.\n\n7. Their stand on Nuclear Power is unclear. But they seem to be leaning against it. But Nuclear power is the way forward. Isnt it?\n\n8. Some people pointed out on TV that AAP is going to be an elitist party. Many the bigwigs from the industries who have achieved a lot in their profession are now thinking of jumping into politics with AAP tickets. But what is wrong is that these people have done naught for the society and are not really connected to the grassroots.\n\nOne might say that this big an article was written surely by some anti AAP person with much time to spare. But do give a thought to this. I have written all this only to shed light on some issues that the mainstream TV has glossed over.",

Just this afternoon in Pune, I was driving my scooter on a road, which is not crowded at all anytime otherwise, but today was full of traffic due to a local election. I had gone just one turn away from my house, and then I bumped into an Innova in front of me.. the Innova had also braked.I don't fully recall though if it was the driver's fault or mine, there was a little dent and scratch on the back plastic guard, and it was unusual bumper to bumper traffic ahead of us.\n\nDriver said he will call owner till then told me to wait. I told him I have to go somewhere, and that it's a minor thing, still I waited. When the owner came he said its too much of work, it is new vehicle etc (I looked it up online, the plastic part would be around 3-4k).\n\nThey checked my vehicle too, and found it dented, but I told him it was caused much earlier. All there was due to today's impact was a little white paint from the Innova plastic part. I had to give them my name, mobile, vehicle number, but I have the driver's number only, not the owner's.\n\nI asked the guy his name, and looked him up on fb, also checked his vehicle number on RTO site. Found that the guy is a wrestler and son of a local rural NCP politician..the types who flaunt their wealth.. and that the vehicle is registered in the father's name. \n\nIn the end I told him that I braked still it hit, I apologised many times and even told him I didn't do it purposely, had it been my fault I would have ran off right away, he said we will see..not that he threatened me in any way but I'm really tensed after discovering this info about him. Family knows nothing about this. What do you think can he do? And what should I do?",

        "content": "Budget Car audio recommendations. I am planning to upgrade the speakers in my mother's Celerio AMT. I have no clue what company speakers its got currently but my ass sounds better in the morning than those shitboxes. Currently it has got a Sony wx-gt99btm HU and shitbox speakers.\n\nMy budget is 5-8k for the upgrade. I dont want the sound to be loud but I want it to be as good as I can get. My mom mostly listens to the radio and some old hindi songs so I dont want very high bass either. The HU has 52Wx4 written on it so I suppose it can supply 52Watts to 4 speakers (or 104Watts to two).\n\nA bit of online research made me realize I might need two Component Speakers and One Subwoofer. OR I can get 4 good Coaxial speakers. Or maybe two Components and Two coaxials. I am basically stumped with this.\n\nI have a 600W Sony Xplod Amp and a 300W Subwoofer currently on the family innova which just stays idle. But that Sub is too big for the Celerio, however if absolutely necessary I ll cannibalize the Amp.\n\nPlease suggest me the speaker configuration which would suit my needs. Also, I want both the front and back of the car to sound good coz sometimes mom drives but many times she's the passenger with a driver driving.",

Floods wreck havoc in Bihar - Why can't 'Modi save 15,000' like he did in Uttarakhand in 2013?\n\nWe all clearly remember how stories overflowing with machismo, bravado were floating around in 2013 when Uttarakhand was struck with floods, landslides.\n\nBack in those last days of 'corrupt, maun-mohan ki sarkar', a gentleman from Gujarat was ubiquitous. He was seen in SRCC Delhi speaking on Economics & challenges ahead for India, in Chandigarh discussing 'IIT problems' with army wives & their kids & heck, he event suggested how India can win '8-10 Olympic medal' by 'Mapping army jawans who have '\u0930\u0941\u091a\u093f' / Interest in sports or \u0916\u0947\u0932\u0928\u0947 \u0915\u0942\u0926\u0928\u0947.\n\nIn one of those days, this ubiquitous gentleman apparently saved '15,000' stranded pilgrims from tough flooded territory, apparently dived into scene with Volvos and innovas and saved thousands of pilgrims while our own 'incompetent' army could rescue 1200-1500 people a day (24*7 operation were on).\n\nIn the age of whatsApp & 400 news channels, Indians 'consume' news all day. In few hours, this gentleman was a hero, a superman except he didn't wear a cape or laal chaddi on top of his pyjama. Women wanted their husband's to ape this gentleman, Mother's wanted their son's to be like this gentleman, a new hindu hriday samrat was born. A man who could do wonders with NO external support, NO logistics or relief operation - He could dash in with innovas and save 15THOUSAND People. In the age of meek maun mohan, orgasming Indians had found their next way to salvation.\n\nEXCEPT: This gentleman was a fraud, he never saved 15,000 people, he never solved IIT problems, he never even 'mapped army jawan to their interest to 8-10 medals' can be won. He was adept at planting stories, creating perceptions, promising Utopia.\n\nIt's like, someone announces in public - 'Hey you know, Amit Shah is a goat fucker' Sometime later the goat in discussion clarifies in public - 'Hang on guys, Amit shah never fucked me'. Irrespective of clarification from alleged victim, the taint never goes off, the perception stays intact - Amit will permenently will remebered as someone 'who fucked a goat, na?'\n\nThis is what Modi has been doing to ascend to power. \n\nhttp://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/narendra-modi-lands-in-uttarakhand-flies-out-with-15000-gujaratis/articleshow/20724044.cms\n\nIndia is facing multiple natural calamities at the moment -\n\nBihar - http://www.firstpost.com/india/heavy-rains-in-nepal-cause-floods-in-bihar-nitish-kumar-calls-high-level-meeting-to-assess-situation-3927485.html\n\nHimachal - http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/monster-landslip-in-himachal-buries-vehicles-50-dead/articleshow/60050767.cms\n\nI never see stories like Modi dashing and saving 15,000 being planted again.",

        "content": "Suggestions for a ~6L car. I'm looking at buying a car to replace my super mini. It has served me well, but the car is too small for road trips and will unfortunately have to go. This is why I need a larger car. Since 6L isnt that much for a large car, I'm almost certain that I'll have to buy used, but that shouldn't be a problem provided the car is not too old and hasn't been driven too much. \n\nMy two main requirements (aside from it being larger) is that the car should be cheap to maintain and should have ABS and airbags. I made a mistake not buying a car with airbags with my existing car and I don't want to repeat that mistake. \n\nPetrol, diesel doesn't matter. Also, aside from the usual service history check and stuff, what do you recommend I check while buying a used car? \n\nIf someone has stories (good or bad) about their used car purchase, I'd love to hear them. My budget isn't strict, and I'm fine with extending it if I can find a car which is worth it. \n\nCars currently being considered: \n\n* Ford EcoSport. I've heard both, good and bad things about it. Should be a decent buy if I can find a good example. \n\n* Renault Duster. Not the largest car and certainly not my favorite, but I have to say that the car is not bad at all. \n\n* VW Vento. Was going to buy this before I went for my current car. \n\n* Innova. I feel it's a bit of a gamble considering if only get older and heavily used cars, but I've always loved the Innova. \n\nOther suggestions are welcome, too! \n\nThanks, reddit!\n\nEdit: decided against a used car. Looking at a new car around 10L which will seat more than 5 and won't drive like a boat. \n\nEdit: thought a lot and felt that there's no point ignoring 5 seaters because the trips with 5+ passengers will be rare.",

        "content": "Our industry leaders - Reliance, Tata, Infosys, Birla, Mahindra are idiots. They are so incompetent and their innovation is dogshit. I can't think of a single major innovation coming out of these companies and they take such a high place in Indian minds. The only reason they survive is because of artificial low competition from foreign companies (enormous import duties, etc.). Nobody is bringing their best products to India anymore. Let's look at automobile sector for a proof:\n\n1. Ford left\n2. Fiat left\n3. Suzuki don't sell their best cars here\n4. Toyota gave up - they are just reselling Maruti now\n5. Honda trimmed down its offering\n\nThe \"industry leaders\" destroy local ecosystem by discouraging scientific approach to design and manufacturing. It's so hard to build a global quality product from India. I'll give you examples:\n\n1. Try to find something specialised like \"High temperature paint\" or [tube fittings made to an established standard](https://products.swagelok.com/en/fittings/c/100), you find very few options.\n2. Poor craftsmanship culture. I frequently get wrong angles and lengths even when I hire someone with a CNC.\n3. Poor tools - hundreds of times I couldn't find the right tools I needed to build something I wanted.\n4. Poor financing - it's only open to the already rich never to someone just talented.\n\nIn most other countries, the big companies actively improve the ecosystem by **developing standards,**  training the local talent, promoting a **rational thought** to solving problems, opening their infrastructure to startups and above all by **not funding idiots to power**. Narayanamurthy tells youth to work 16 hours. That is equivalent to saying, \"Work harder not smarter\".\n\nSo much incompetence - why is it ok for a person to run an electrical parts shop knowing nothing about electrical parts? I once asked a shop owner for 16A plug, he pointed to me 250V rating and said this means it will work for 16A too. This shop was literally in the industrial area in that city. It takes literally 1 second to see that what I'm talking about is not what's written there.\n\nWe are bleeding the last good people. We missed the automobile revolution, we'll miss the electric revolution too. Why do we not point out how dumb and idiotic our \"industry leaders\" are? My question is what does it take to take down these idiots from their pedestal? [Who is actually working](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ts0uuz/which_groups_are_genuinely_working_to_change/) in this direction?",

        "content": "Why do Indian state and central governments not promote domestic car brands?. First and foremost, let me clarify that this isn\u2019t about any specific political party which may be in power in any state or the center. I\u2019d some family members working in the central government earlier, and this is a trend that I\u2019ve been observing since the early 2000\u2019s. Previously, government vehicles would exclusively be either HM Ambassadors, or Tata SUVs for those who had field assignments, and the Maruti Suzuki Gypsy for police/military. However, in the 2000s, I saw these vehicles being replaced with Mitsubishi Lancers, Maruti Suzuki Esteems & SX4s, Toyota Corollas, Camrys, Innovas & Qualys , Honda Citys and Accords, and Mahindra Boleros. The point being that while we still had Indian brands in the mix, we had a lot more foreign brands, and that\u2019s partly understandable because the car market had been liberalized since the 90s, and maybe around this time the older vehicles needed to be replaced.\n\nHowever, at the same time, I\u2019ve observed in America that the governments (city/state/federal) exclusively use vehicles built by American manufacturers (Ford/Dodge/GM). For those who know even the US President uses a GM made Cadillac (customized of course). On the contrary, the Indian President and PM use customized a BMW and Mercedes.\n\nCould this be purely symbolic - maybe coz these American brands don\u2019t exclusively build all their North American cars in the US, and have factories outside the US as well. But at the same time, they still do have a lot of factories in the US (some maybe closing as we speak, but that\u2019s a different topic) which create American jobs.\n\nSo, the question is why don\u2019t the Indian governments (at all levels) push for a similar drive? I think regardless of party politics, every party is on board with Make-In-India/Buy-In-India, and if new factories come during their reigns which create more jobs, they can take credit for generating more jobs.",

[^(nih.gov)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5336083/)\n\nHaving an **autonomous regional satellite navigation system of one\u2019s own offers strategic autonomy in military operations.** The GPS that we have known and used all along is the satellite-based radio navigation system owned by the US government and operated by the American Air Force. During the **Kargil War 20 years ago, the US refused to provide India critical information on the movement and precise location of Paki enemy troops.** [^(toi)](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/How-Kargil-spurred-India-to-design-own-GPS/articleshow/33254691.cms) A need for an indigenous satellite navigation was felt earlier, but **Kargil experience made the nation realize it's inevitability.** Geopolitical needs teaches us that some countries can deny us the service in times of conflict, **a way of arm twisting**.\n\nWith an accuracy of **<10 m on Restricted and Encrypted Service (RES)** while an accuracy of **<20 m on Standard Positioning Service (SPS)**, IRNSS will offer 2 level of  services for very differing purposes. [^(isro.gov.in \\[PDF\\])](https://www.isro.gov.in/sites/default/files/irnss_sps_icd_version1.1-2017.pdf) Almost **all Military and Reconnaissance applications will utilize RES while SPS will be available for civilian uses.** [^(unvienna \\[PDF\\])](http://www.oosa.unvienna.org/pdf/icg/2008/expert/2-3.pdf)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe IRNSS space segment architecture **consists of 3 satellites in GEO** (Geostationary Orbit) at 32.5\u00b0, 83\u00b0 and 131.5\u00b0 East while **4 satellites in geosynchronous orbit** placed at inclination of 29\u00b0 with longitude crossing at 55\u00b0 and 111.75\u00b0 East forming an analemma. [^(isac.gov.in)](https://www.isac.gov.in/navigation/irnss.jsp) Out of the 4 GSO satellites, **the first sat IRNSS-1A failed in orbit due to atmoic clock malfunction.** On August 31, 2017, **sat IRNSS-1H was meant to replace defunct IRNSS-1A, failed to deploy due to malfunction in payload fairing mechanism.** Though failures are not uncommon in space missions of even developed nations, **India is not in a position where it can afford even relatively minor glitches neither financially nor in terms of reaching the higher goals it has set for itself.** [^(firstpost)](https://www.firstpost.com/tech/news-analysis/isros-irnss-1h-fiasco-failures-are-common-in-space-missions-but-india-cant-afford-them-at-this-juncture-3998717.html)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[IRNSS Analemma](https://preview.redd.it/t6bwmg4ilms31.jpg?width=876&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=867731da13b5317df301edcf9e2adae2448ef6aa)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUnlike **GPS which is dependent only on L-band, NAVIC has dual frequency (S and L bands).** When low frequency signal travels through atmosphere, its velocity changes due to atmospheric disturbances. US banks on atmospheric model to assess frequency error and it has to update this model from time to time to assess the exact error. In India's case, the actual delay is assessed by measuring the difference in delay of dual frequency (S and L bands). Therefore, **NavIC is not dependent on any model to find the frequency error and is more accurate than GPS**. [^(toi)](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/get-ready-indias-own-gps-set-to-hit-the-market-early-next-year/articleshow/58876680.cms)\n\nStudies have also shown **marked improvement in GDoP (Geometric dilution of precision) values when IRNSS is used in conjunction with GPS constellation** for position fix in primary coverage region of IRNSS. Hence IRNSS can be augmented with GPS to improve position accuracy in the given region. [^(ias.ac.in)](https://www.ias.ac.in/article/fulltext/reso/022/12/1155-1174)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe I**RNSS is being developed parallel to the GAGAN (GPS Aided GEO Augmented Satellite Navigation)** program that in essence use GPS signals for navigation but after making them much more reliable for safety critical applications like in civil aviation., the **ISRO SBAS (Satellite Based Augmentation System)** version of an overlay system for GNSS signal corrections. [^(earth.esa.int)](https://earth.esa.int/web/eoportal/satellite-missions/i/irnss) As of 2013, the statutory filing for frequency spectrum of **Global Indian Navigational System (GINS) satellite orbits in international space, has been completed.** [^(hindubusinessline)](https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/todays-paper/tp-economy/Global-Indian-Navigation-system-on-cards/article20040673.ece) **GINS is supposed to have a constellation of 24 satellites**, positioned 24,000 km (14,913 mi) above Earth. [^(wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Regional_Navigation_Satellite_System#Global_Indian_Navigational_System_(GINS))\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn Sep 24, 2019 Global mobile telephony standards body, **3GPP, gave its approval to NaVIC (Proposed jointly by Reliance Jio and ISRO).** [^(3gpp.org \\[XLSX\\])](https://www.3gpp.org/ftp/TSG_RAN/WG2_RL2/TSGR2_107/Docs/TDoc_List_Meeting_RAN2%23107.xlsx)  The approval has been given for the system\u2019s use in Rel-16 LTE and Rel-17 5G NR specifications, paving the way for wider commercial adoption of NaVIC, **allowing it to be integrated with 4G, 5G and internet of things (IoT).** [^(3gpp.org \\[ZIP\\])](https://www.3gpp.org/ftp/TSG_RAN/WG2_RL2/TSGR2_107/Docs/R2-1908707.zip) Thus, electronics companies can start designing and building integrated circuits and mass manufacture other products uniquely created to be compatible with NavIC. From what all scant information I was able to gather it seems **Broadcom was first to introduce BCM47756** [^(3gpp.org \\[ZIP\\])](https://www.3gpp.org/ftp/TSG_RAN/WG2_RL2/TSGR2_107/Docs/R2-1908706.zip)  chipset integrated with NavIC and **Xiaomi Mi8 was the first phone to have the capabilities.** [^(insidegnss)](https://insidegnss.com/europe-meets-india-event-promotes-gnss-research-industry/) *Will the introduction of indigenous satnav be another step closer towards being a global power?

        "content": "Using informal savings to buy a car \u2013 any tax issues?. Hey everyone,\n\nNeed some advice on behalf of my uncle, who's a farmer.\n\nHe owns about 10 acres of land (in his and his wife's name) and is around 42 years old. Over the years, he has saved money from farming and then giving it as hand loans to other farmers and relatives. They pay him back with some interest and through this he has managed to save around \u20b925 lakhs.\n\nNow he wants to buy a Toyota Innova using that money, paying all at once without a loan. Some of the money is in literal cash and some with people who owe him which he is planning to take back sometime soon. \n\nWith the Income Tax Department being pretty active these days, what is the best and safest way for him to buy the car without getting into trouble?\n\nAny tips on how to show the source of funds or handle this properly?\n\nThanks in advance!",

        "content": "I'm fed up with my parents, What should I do now?. As the title suggests, I'm kinda fed up with my parents. They seriously need therapy.\n\n I'll start with my mom. She's actually really selfish. Since childhood, I was never allowed to go out and play with other kids. She says that I am allergic to dust and that she'll have to clean my clothes which are full of dust. I ignored her and played out few times but eventually gave in. I got immersed in mobile and the internet. I was never let alone to go out and explore like my neighbour kids. They used to hang out the entire day and ride their bicycle across the neighbourhood and to town. She restricted me to ride the cycle within my house premises. Then she never allows or gives me privacy. She always intrudes me while I'm bathing, changing clothes etc. The main reason is she treats me like a child. She tells me to do this, do that, wear this dress. That's not a big issue as far as I'm concerned. But whenever I tell her Im going outside, she takes the clothes including my inner wear from the cupboard even though I tell her I can do it myself. I think she has some disorder that makes her think she will lose authority of the house and authority over me if I start being independent. She loves when I ask her for help. And she advices me for 10-15 mins if I do the same. She does not allow me to iron my own clothes, enter the kitchen and do the dishes, prepare tea or anything that makes me independent. When I was installing my PC in my room, she interfered and said that the PC should be installed in the hall because apparently the Internet cable will have to be longer. I still don't understand that. I think she does not want me to have privacy. She also doesn't like when I lock my doors. So basically she made me a useless, dependant, introvert kid. I have done several attempts during childhood to break away from her control. I even went out to play with kids for 1 week when I was 11 or 12 but apparently my brother got injured when another kid accidentally rode the bike over his leg which was a minor case. She held on to it and permanently banned me from going outside. Whenever guests come to the house, she gets out from the back of the house and talks and deals with them outside the house itself. She rarely let's guests in. She hates when I say I'm inviting a friend to the house. She reasons with me that \"The house will have dust and dirt if he comes to the house\". Also, whenever we come home, she forces me to scrub the legs hard for the dirt or something to come off and wash our legs with soap before entering the house. WTF logic is that? We are going to bath anyways so why do that? Because of that she installed a outdoor bathroom/shower which is a small cube like thing outside our house. Also, she doesn't allow me to shift table fans, tables or anything from one place to another. My dad once did so and she screamed and shouted and she slammed her head in the wall herself as if in a sign of protest(I felt really bad and ashamed that day). My room actually has an AC which I don't want to turn on during racing season but she stops me from turning on the fan during that time and forces me to sleep with AC on. She's saying that when fan turns on, there will be dust in the room. I'm really stuck now. I can't go out, can't move things in my own room, I can't invite friends, My relatives and cousins don't come to my home because my mother will not let them in. Whenever I see my relatives and cousins they ask me \"Why are you not going out of the house or letting us into your house?\". I don't have an answer and it destroys my self confidence. I told her a lot of times to see a doctor but she psychiatrist but she won't. Whenever I'm in school hostel, I feel like it is the real me. I joke around, have fun, talk a lot but when I'm at home, I feel like a different person. I don't feel comfortable laughing, joking or going outside. The main reason is her. My MOM. I still get nightmares thinking if my friend asks to come to my home. I get real anxiety if they come to my home. I fear that they might dislike my mom's outrageous behaviour. Also I fear they will dislike me because I do not go out of the house and be independent. I fear that they will know that I do not have friends outside my school Circle (which the main reason is my mom). She also occassionally swears at me. Calls me bad words and curses at my dad. My biggest dream now is to escape this hellhole of a home and live in some hostel or room.\n\nNow my dad. He is the biggest gambler ever. Not literally but I'll explain. He was born in a poor farmer family but he did a diploma and started working in Dubai. He earned a good amount every month and he built our house. But he got his biggest opportunity in Oman where he was offered \u20b91.25L/month salary + Free apartment + Free transport + Free food + Subsidised School for me. He took the offer and we moved there. But after 1 year, he did a dumb thing. He took a loan of \u20b950L and started a hotel business without even having any business experience. He employed 10-15 people before the business even started. The business was a huge failure and he lost the money. Meanwhile his company also found this out and kicked him out. I studied 1 year there in a good school but had to leave because of him. He lost \u20b950L + Our livelihood in Oman. We came back to India and he got another job in UAE paying \u20b92L/month but quit that too because his boss was upset at him at work. Then he got another job in Kazakhstan paying \u20b93L/month but quit that too because of his laziness. He always believed he is born to do business. He kept saying he will because a multi-millionare within a year. He kept quitting jobs and now he worked in India itself for \u20b930k/month. He then started a milk business which failed and he lost \u20b91L. Now he started another Tyre business which is now running at loss. He also has a habit of spending money aimlessly. He buys random expensive clothes, shoes, phones, TV, Expensive chairs etc. He lost all his money on all of these. He does not have a sense of fear over financial ruin. He is now telling me that he'll sell our inherited land and buy a Innova Crysta. I have no words. \n\nThe only way we still are not bankrupt is my mothers small rental unit that gives us \u20b920-30k/month. There is a lot more to say about my relatives. But that's whole another lesson. Any advice on what I should do? I have done everything in my power to make them right. \n\n(Sorry for rant. Didn't intend this to be so long)\n\nTLDR : My parents are insufferable. What can I do to fix it?\n\n(I just passed out of school, so moving out is not an option. I'm also repeating for JEE near my house)",

I am sharing this Phillippines review of the Toyota Innova, because I'd like to know the community's opinions on the car, which is currently the best-selling car in Indonesia (alongside the last-gen version of the car, which also has got its own unique customers due to the use of diesel and RWD, which combination aren't found on the current gen car), the base of the car's production. This car also serves as the first hybrid car produced by Toyota in Indonesia, although the engine is still produced in India.\n\nI tried the car as a passenger on a short trip, and it does feel like a doozy for someone whose family car is a lower end 7-seater also sold by Toyota, the Avanza.\n\nI'd like to put an Indonesian review right here, but reviews from the country in English is kinda rare to see.\n\n[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcLW7YgjAy0)",

I'm looking into getting my first car in college some time before 2013 and I need some advice. I'm a sophomore in college.\n\nMy parents will be paying for the car, and I'll be paying for its maintenance through my rather generous allowance and a part time job. My parents are well off as they are both professionals, and they are used to my older brother's less-frugal lifestyle that they're given me enough to live his lifestyle even though I am a cheapskate. They also live literally on the opposite side of the Earth, so they don't know much about anything over here in Texas. When I asked them about cars they made it pretty clear I need to do my own research so here I am.\n\nI think my parents would rather buy a new car but I honestly don't believe that's a good investment due to the immense availability of used cars compared to where I used to live. I'm currently looking more into Asian cars due to their reliability, but apart from that I honestly do not know what I am supposed to be looking for. I only have experience driving a [Honda City](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda_City#Fourth_generation_.282002.E2.80.932008.29), [Toyota Rush](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_Rush#Second_generation), [Nissan Sylphy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nissan_Bluebird_Sylphy#Second_generation_.28G11.3B_2005.E2.80.932012.29) and [Toyota Innova](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_Innova) none of which exist where I live now in Texas.\n\nI would be using the car to commute about 15-20 minutes every morning and again at night to college on a daily basis, as well as simply driving around to get to places. I'm looking for a car that's comfortable and practical to drive. I'm also used to driving stick, and I would like to know if any of you have anything to say about buying cars with manual transmission - is it worth the investment? Is the better gas mileage significant?\n\nRight now I'm looking at cars like a Honda Accord, Nissan Altima, Mazda6, but I'm willing to listen to any piece of advice you can give me. My budget isn't set in stone but I'm just throwing a number out there that I think is realistic.",

So I have a Toyota SUV (Innova is the type which is only available in southeast asia AFAIK), before that I have older version of the car.\n\nIn the country I live there can be quite a lot of uphill driving. In my old car, My car automatic's transmission have the option to switch to option \"3\" or \"1\" or \"2\" or \"L\" alongside with the option \"D\".\n\nUsually when I'm driving steep uphill, I switch to \"2\" or even \"1\" if it's at extreme angle, Because when I use \"D\", the car moves a lot slower and the transmission went to high gear and low RPM which is not what I want when driving uphill.\n\nNow since my new car have the tiptronic thing instead of \"3\", \"2\", \"1\", \"L\" option. Do I just engage tiptronic and put it in lower gear (2nd gear or 3rd gear) when driving uphill?\n\n*EDIT : So I got the name mixed up with porsche's system, It's just that almost everyone I know (including toyota salesman) use the term \"tiptronic\" a lot.",

        "content": "Why I sold my Tesla Model 3 Performance & went back to gas. I owned a 2019 Tesla Model 3 Performance for roughly two years and 15,000 miles. I'm going to distill my key learnings and experiences here, in an attempt to educate others on EVs and reach some form of closure. My ownership could best be summed-up as a love/hate relationship, ending with crazy used car values offering me the out I'd been quietly seeking. Clearly, I decided EVs aren't for me - at least, not yet. I'm not a \"paid big oil shill\" or someone who's trying to short the stock, as I'm sure some of the Tesla nuts will claim. I'm just a car enthusiast (disclaimer: not an engineer) standing at the same crossroads as the rest of you, wondering what sounds future children will make long after (if?) our beloved bureaucrats outlaw the ICE.\n\nEverything I'm writing here is based on my own unique tastes and preferences. How the pros and cons balance out at the end is entirely up to you. And that's fine. Choice is great. Note that this post centers on Battery EVs (BEVs) at the time of this writing, which comprise the vast majority of EVs on the road today.\n\nAnd yeah. This got way longer than I anticipated. But it was cathartic for me and I hope it's at least somewhat useful to someone out there.\n\n# EV performance & its accessibility\n\nI'll start with what ultimately sold me on the car - **Immense, instant power.** The war in the \"pure acceleration\" category is pretty much over - just take a look at Jason Cammisa's video with the Model S Plaid vs. the BMW M5 CS and Cadillac Crazy. They're not even on the same planet. Not only is the acceleration brutal, but it's consistent (everything else held constant - more on that later). Look up any number of 0 - 60 videos on YouTube, and you'll notice that the times are all remarkably close, especially if there are multiple runs in the same video.\n\nAnd how could they not be? Software and traction control are fundamental to EV operation. Adjustments take mere milliseconds. The amount of \"stuff\" involved between your right foot and the tires is a joke compared to an ICE car. And it's basically idiot-proof - even with the Track Mode dialed to 100% hoon in my TM3P, it was nearly impossible to make a mistake. You just put your foot down and the car takes care of the rest, with literally zero drama.\n\n# Electric motors are great\n\nAnd all of this performance comes with no mechanical sympathy. I never felt an ounce of it, flogging my Model 3 - there's really nothing to \"break\" mechanically in the way of the drivetrain. The entire drive unit consists of the motor, a few gears, the diff, a pump to circulate the oil... and that's really about it. No fried clutches, exploding transmissions, shredded differentials, etc... it's always ready to pounce at any speed, in any situation. Electric motors themselves are relatively inexpensive, quiet, clean, tough, extremely efficient, insanely long-lasting, and have an excellent power/size ratio. When it comes to to the task of turning energy into mechanical force, I'm not sure there's anything better.\n\nAND! You don't even have to worry about getting the motors up to operating temperature before you get on it. During the colder months, it easily takes 10+ minutes of highway driving for the oil of an ICE to warm up (you are looking at your oil and not the coolant temp, right?). I quite enjoyed leaving my neighborhood with the ability to give it full \"throttle\" right out of the gate. It's like teleporting straight into any 3-car gap, no matter where. (But there are limitations to this - more on that later, too.)\n\n# Convenience & running costs\n\nYou can also have your cake and eat it, too! There's no need to feel like a moron with a 550 HP ICE engine idling under the hood in daily stop and go traffic. My TM3P was an efficient, calm, quiet, easy, comfortable way of getting from Point A to Point B while being more similar performance-wise to a BMW M3 than a Toyota Corolla - with fewer running costs than either. True, the suspension, brakes, thermal management gubbins, etc., are largely synonymous between an EV and ICE. But when it comes to the actual propulsion, there's basically zero wear and tear. Just a dumb motor that doesn't care about much, and will probably last well past 1 million miles. With a new battery, you're basically looking at a brand-new drivetrain.\n\nAnd yes, running on electricity is cheaper than filling up an ICE car - this is where most of the EV \"savings\" materialize. In my experience, electricity in the mid-Atlantic region cost roughly 12\u00a2/kWh and 9\u00a2/kWh in the PNW. For my TM3P, that equates to about $10 and $8 in each region, respectively, to travel \\~265 miles, assuming: A 75 kWh battery pack, lifetime consumption average of 280 Wh/mile, and a 13% charging loss, **IF** you can charge at home (which is key to the \"get in and go\" convenience of an EV - without that, forget it). Subtract oil + filter changes, spark plugs, failing chain tensioners, bad oxygen sensors, burnt out cat converters, and other annoying problems, and the running costs quickly stack up in the EV's favor. You rarely even use the brakes! Even with the initial purchase price of an EV still being notably higher than gasoline, on average, you can make the argument that it still comes out cheaper in the long run. But the wildcard here is \"how long is 'long run?'\"\n\nThe cost of battery pack replacement isn't discussed as often as I'd like. Some of the earliest Model S packs are already starting to fail - only about 10 years later. When I sold my E46, it was approaching 20 years old. It still faithfully serves its new owner on a daily basis, today. Maybe I've only heard about the edge cases, and the Model 3's will all last considerably last longer, but I personally never got comfortable being part of a beta test. The batteries in these cars remain a delicate subject, which brings us to the poo-poo part of this post.\n\n# Let's face it - batteries still suck.\n\nElectric motors are one thing; powering them is an entirely different story. Conventional lithium-ion batteries are really the only currently viable way to power EVs en masse. Part of what makes them great is that they're extremely efficient when it comes to storing and dispensing energy - especially compared to fossil fuels and other solutions in the works. You put electricity in, electricity comes back out. The leap from energy generation to use is extremely short. But they do have notable limitations around longevity, performance, and cost, especially when it comes to shuffling a 2+ ton vehicle around. Whether you're willing to accept these limitations is up to you.\n\n**Degradation is inevitable**\n\nAt this point, the oldest Model Ss on the road at about 10 years old. Although the Model 3 pack is newer and has less cells (thus less to go wrong - 7,920 in the Plaid vs 4,416 in a TM3 LR), we don't yet have enough information to truly know what to expect from these packs from a longevity perspective. Unlikely that Tesla will ever share this info, either. If Elon is to be believed, the Model 3 pack should last 300,000 - 500,000 miles. If Elon is to be believed, fully-autonomous cars would've been shuffling us around long before 2020. We know that with proper care, pretty much any modern ICE car should be able to surpass the 250,000 mile mark without many problems. So anyone who likes to run their cars for as long as possible and buys an EV should know that they're venturing into the unknown.\n\nYes, I'm aware that there are examples out there of Model Ss surpassing several hundred thousand miles - with the caveat being that a not-insignificant number of them of them involved battery and/or drive unit replacements at various points. There are also Hyundai Elantras out there with 1,000,000+ miles on their original powertrains.\n\nBut note that degradation is only one part of the story. Upon my departure of Tesland, I can't recall hearing of anyone replacing packs due to natural degradation. All the replacement stories I came across were pack failures in one form or another. Yes, the internet is a fantastic place for angry people to vent, and it could be that the population's negatively skewed - like the Finnish guy who recently blew up his Model S on YouTube. But the reality is that if one single cell - not brick, not module, but **cell** \\- fails, the pack is done. That cell turns into a parasite. The car will struggle and ultimately fail to balance out the pack, eventually giving up one morning, telling you to GFY, and to take it to Tesla. Last I heard, replacing the battery on a Model S was \\~$24,000 and \\~$16,000 for a Model 3. This is just one type of sudden pack failure that I've heard about, and what makes it especially concerning is that the root cause seems fairly trivial relative to the catastrophe that ensues. Maybe it's overblown and maybe I'm being paranoid, but the chances of this happening are real, and only increase in with age...\n\n...which is something else that affects battery degradation, as indicated by Tesla's latest shenanigan of selling \"new\" cars with batteries from 4+ year-old stock, claiming that range \"may be reduced by 12%.\" (At the time of this writing: Model 3 SR drive unit + battery warranty is 8 years/100,000 miles, LR is 8 years/120,000 miles). So yes, the car is literally getting worse every day by the sheer virtue of just sitting there - especially in extreme climates. How pronounced is the impact of age vs. use vs. fast-charging is anybody's guess, but it's a reality that needs to be acknowledged.\n\nSo if you're comfortable with basically ending up with a 2 - 3 ton paperweight if some electrical fault appears in the pack, and have the means to shovel cash into the Tesla furnace without much concern for what the future may hold, then you're probably less worried about the battery. I envy your fortitude and tolerance for risk - it's something I thought I could swallow, but couldn't. As I learned these realities, I became increasingly less comfortable with the prospect of keeping the car past its warranty period. Yes, an ICE can also fail (a timeworn Tesla fanatic argument), but not many ICE failures end in the car being completely inoperable - especially in modern cars which are ridiculously reliable and serviceable by anyone.\n\n**Mitigation means sacrifice**\n\nIf you want the battery to last as long as possible, you have to be nice to it.\n\nYou don't want to leave the battery fully-charged for extended periods of time, or let it drop below 10% - there are arguments that doing either of these is more detrimental to battery longevity than supercharging. But this is why the 90 - 100% block on a Tesla's charge indicator is labeled \"Trip.\" (I don't think any other manufacturers do this... And part of me wonders whether it's a Teslan strategy to maximize rated range.) So right off the batt (ha), you're 20% down if you're concerned for battery health. It's OK to charge to 100% right before a long trip, but the lower, the better, around town. There are people who charge to 90%, 80%, or even lower on a daily basis as a result. Jeff Dahn recommends 70% to maximize life - you can look him up. Now, paying $50K+ for a vehicle like this and running it below its potential for most of its life just... sucks. Especially seeing as the car produces its maximum power output only at about 90%+ state of charge (SoC).\n\nThat's right. Until they develop a battery that behaves like it's filled with a liquid, this is going to remain a reality. Batteries are only at their best when they're charged to 90 - 100% of their capacity. This becomes especially noticeable at highway speeds at a low SoC, since EVs accelerate far more brutally from a stop than from a roll. The car is still **plenty** quick on the highway, but this does result in some ass-clenching moments when passing cars on a divided yellow and you're used to driving around in God Mode. You put your foot down at <30% SoC @ 55 mph, expecting one response, but get quite another. (Disclaimer: Although this is a battery reality, it's also a byproduct of the car having a single gear - no motor can rev to infinity.)\n\nBatteries also do *not* like extreme temperature. Batteries are like people - they're most comfortable at the temperatures we're most comfortable - right around 70\u00b0F. This impacts **both** their output and charging. So in the cold, they do not want to charge, and they do not want to give you full power. When it's *extremely* cold, expect to lose 30 - 40% of your range thanks to this convenient little truth, combined with the fact that you're probably running the heat. In lower temperatures, my Model 3's \"acceleration/regen\" indicator frequently told me that the car was both power-limited and/or regen-limited because of a cold-soaked battery. What does \"cold\" mean? I don't know - and seems to change with software updates. Towards the end of my ownership, it seemed that the car sitting overnight in the high 40s/low 50s was enough to result in power limiting to protect the battery. Preheating the car before departure mitigates this problem, which eats into your range unless you're plugged in. (Note that Tesla also recently updated the Model 3 with a heat pump vs. a resistive heater, which sounds like it's notably helped with cold weather driving range. However, initial accounts of how this affects cold weather power output were mixed, as cabin HVAC and battery were both effectively \"competing\" for scavenging what little heat was available. Whether or not these problems have since been remedied, I'm not sure.)\n\n**Performance (with caveats)**\n\nExcessive heat also presents problems. Since an ICE vehicle's engine is operating at about 212\u00b0F, the ambient temperature differential is generally more than enough to provide cooling. Even temps of 100\u00b0F+ provide plenty of space to act as a sink. But when \"hot\" is closer to \\~120\u00b0F, as in for a Li-ion battery, things get a bit more challenging. Obviously this won't be a relevant problem for 99.98% of people, but it is an issue if you're planning on sustained high-performance driving. I think the problem is \\*almost\\* solved through aftermarket components like larger radiators and auxiliary cooling pumps, but as of my leaving the community a number of months ago, it was still an issue for the Model 3, even in cooler temperatures. (Whether they've solved this with the Plaid, I'm not sure - I don't know if anyone's been able to run it for long enough prior to overcooking the horribly insufficient brakes and/or tires.) And if you are planning on tracking your Model 3, anticipate something like <60 miles of track driving range because of an EV's sensitivity to stress, and the simple fact that the car isn't really carrying that much energy on board.\n\nLook up Jason Fenske's Engineering Explained video on battery density on YouTube for an excellent explanation of this. It boils down to the fact that a gallon of gasoline has roughly 13x the energy density than the best of modern Li-ion batteries by volume - and we're strictly talking about the cells here. I.e., it doesn't take into account the fact that there are a lot of other things that need to surround those cells to get them to actually do their job in an EV. The battery pack in a Long Range Model 3 weighs roughly 1,000 lbs... All of the energy contained within equates to roughly 2.2 gallons of gasoline. Which also has the added benefit of being extremely portable, should you find yourself off the beaten path. Try carrying that much energy in batteries by hand... Hope you brought a spare car.\n\nBut that's not the entire story. Yes, EVs do put more of that energy into forward motion than an ICE. But this excellent efficiency is also precisely the reason why EV racing isn't going to approach the length of conventional races any time soon. I'm too dumb to explain it in mathematical terms, but since EVs are so efficient, every \"stressor\" they experience has a disproportionate impact on their range vs. a similar ICE vehicle. The best ICE engines on the road today are something like 35 - 40% efficient, which means that 60 - 65% of the energy in the fuel is basically wasted as heat vs. propulsion. So any kind of \"fast\" or aggressive driving is going to have an exponential impact on an EV's range.\n\nI *never* saw the quoted \"310 miles of range\" that's on the sticker of the Model 3 - and this was on the standard, hateful 18\" MXM4s that came with the car. At one point I ran into a former colleague at my local Tesla service center who was there to discuss that very issue - \"I'm not getting 300+ miles on the highway?\" Yep. The girl at the counter told him the same thing. \"That's normal - anything above 70 MPH is going to dramatically decrease your range.\" If you look on the forums, generally speaking, the lifetime average consumption that many people are getting hovers around 280 Wh/mile. If you drive like a nance, this number will obviously improve, but if you're on this forum... I'm guessing you drive a bit more spiritedly than that.\n\nTo accommodate said spirited driving, I decided to up the car's OEM 235 tires (that's what the new Civic SI comes with, except it's 1,200 lbs lighter) to 265 PS4Ss and installed a set of KW coilovers. As a result of the aforementioned sensitivity, I knew my range would take a hit... but I wasn't quite prepared for how much. One morning while taking my wife to the airport, I said \"ok, I'm just going to drive this like I used to drive the BMW.\" Temps were in the upper 40s/lower 50s, heated seats on, cabin heat on low, averaging 70-ish mph on the highway with one passenger + her luggage. On return, I calculated that my range would've come out to roughly **200 miles.** As many Tesla evangelists would argue, \"well, dass enuff range\" and sure, in most situations, that's probably true. But for me, personally, this added another layer of  anxiety that made any form of enthusiastic driving feel like a sin. There are rumors out there that the Model 3 was literally designed around the wheels and tires, and after experiencing that, I'm inclined to believe it.\n\nSo when people talk about using EVs to tow over extended distances, I'm not exactly sure how that's gonna fly. Especially with heavy/large loads, and considering that such vehicles will need charging stations spacious enough to accommodate them on long-haul trips. And I don't care about this \"o well X% of people don't tow past Y miles.\" I just don't. EV forums are filled with tiresome \"oh you don't need that\" arguments that are somehow supposed to enshroud the fact that for many people, an EV would result in a step backwards when it comes to utility. Anyway, that brings us to everyone's favorite subject - charging infrastructure!\n\n# Do you have a place to charge?\n\nAt the time of this writing, you're kidding yourself if you think that there's any other viable EV option besides a Tesla. And this is assuming you're sticking to generally well-traveled paths in fair-weather conditions. That's because when you buy a Tesla, you're also buying into their supercharger network. The whole experience is generally pretty good - you simply drive up to the charger, plug in your car, and that's it. (Admittedly, I don't have experience with any other EV fast charging, but from what I've heard and seen, it's spotty, at best.)\n\nWhen you go off the beaten path, that's when things get a little dicey. Every time we went somewhere a little \"unique,\" I'd have to carefully think about what type of range I could expect given the weather conditions and if it was realistic to make a round-trip without buggin'. Expect your \"real\" range in a big-battery Model 3 to be more like \\~250 miles on the OEM wheels and tires in good weather. It's true that the car will most likely beat 310 miles in city driving, where EV range is amazing, but that's quite a narrow use case that would take literally all day. Then again, I never actually heard of anyone \"running out of battery\" on the road (in which case your only recourse is to tow the car), but it is a little uncomfortable to read about various close calls, like people trying to keep their families from freezing to death in 10\u00b0F weather with the heater sucking down 3 kW, sitting in 3+ hours of traffic. The car does its damndest to keep you from running out, though, triggering warnings to reduce your speed or telling you that you're driving into a \"supercharger desert\" if it calculates that you're living on the edge.\n\nSo if you do end up traveling into a supercharger desert, with only third-party and destination chargers to rely on, you have to be prepared to ask yourself several questions:\n\n1. Is there charging?\n2. Is it accessible to you? Or is it purely for clients of an establishment, etc.?\n3. Is it compatible? Different standards *do* exist, which is genuinely infuriating if we're gonna get serious about electrified personal transport. This isn't a fucking cellphone. As far as I know, third-party fast charging for Teslas is either sketchy at the moment, or nowhere near as powerful as a 150+ kW supercharger. (By the way, melting a J1772 adapter for a Tesla at any third-party chargers is not uncommon. Ask me how I know.)\n4. Is it powerful enough to get you the range you need in the time you have to charge?\n5. Are you willing to pay the price? A lot of these places are no longer free. Some cost a ridiculous amount for simple Level 2 charging, which is basically like someone asking you to pay for using a dryer outlet.\n6. Is it even going to be available? If it's open parking or it's saturated with other EVs, you might have to wait. If it's Level 2, you're probably doomed.\n\nOnly if you can answer \"Yes\" to those with confidence are you good-to-go. And while it's true that the \"gas savings\" are real, many people don't seem to be factoring in the charging losses I mentioned earlier. Estimate 10 - 15% losses for charging, meaning that you're consuming more electricity than what actually makes it into the pack. These charging losses get worse in extreme temperatures - up to 40% in cold weather. You still come out ahead, but it's an important fact to note if we're going to be honest with ourselves. And the assumption underpinning that argument is always that you are charging at home - a reality that only exists for something like 40% of the American driving public. Charging at a supercharger costs more.\n\nEven if fast-charging the battery wasn't detrimental to its health, it's not like there's a supercharging station on every corner. Building superchargers costs a lot of money, it's not as simple as just \"tapping into the local supercharger line.\" You'll notice that at every station, there's huge enclosed devices turning massive amounts of electricity into DC power. I've heard that Tesla doesn't run these as profit centers, and I do think the pricing to supercharge is very reasonable, but it's still not free (unless you get this incentive) - so charging at a supercharger costs roughly the same in \"fuel\" as driving an econobox.\n\nAnd as batteries continue getting better and better, as they will, keep in mind that a kWh of energy is a kWh of energy. A theoretical 1 MW pack in a theoretical Tesla semi is going to need a supercharger that outputs about 4x the power of today's fastest superchargers to get to where it's going in any reasonable amount of time. If we imagine some super magic battery that's 50 MW and weighs 1 ton, it's not like you'll be able to charge that on a dryer outlet. You need serious power infrastructure on the other side of that battery to make it practical. I'd imagine that powering sustained commercial flight someday, for example, would basically require airports build their own dedicated power plants. Admittedly I have no clue how difficult or easy this is, but I'm sure there's an army of electrical engineers frothing at the keyboard to add to this point.\n\n# From an enthusiast's perspective...\n\nI've already scratched the surface of this, but I'd like to take a moment to talk about my TM3P strictly from an enthusiast's standpoint. There's a lot of stereotypes out there about Tesla owners, and while it is true that many of them have never seen a flathead screwdriver, there's also a substantial number of them coming from high-performance BMWs, Porsche 911s, Dodge Hellcats, McLarens, etc. A good number of them claim that the TM3P is the \"most fun\" car they've ever owned, and that's great, but I guess fun means different things to different people.\n\nI genuinely feel like two years of driving this car has made me a dumber and less engaged driver. I can't quite put my finger on the root of it - I think it's some combination of no noise, no gears, not using the brakes 98% of the time, and the experience of owning a car that basically does everything for you. For most people, unfortunately, that's probably exactly what they want... but not me. I want to be involved. For most of my life, given the cars I've owned, the journey's always at least been *some* part of the reward. And with the Tesla, I can't say that I ever really \"looked forward\" to driving it. It was  such a seamless and uninvolving experience that it just kind of faded into the background as a simple means to an end, rather than something engaging and fun to look forward to.\n\nAnd it's not for lack of capability. With coilovers, sways, various control arms, and wheels + tires, my TM3P was razor sharp and scary quick in any given situation. At auto-xs, I was able to hang with seasoned veterans driving Cayman GT4s equipped with track tires. But even then, as I was getting thrown about the cabin on the sofa-like seat (seriously - most comfortable seats of any car I've ever driven), I couldn't help but feel that something was still missing, and it runs deeper than the difference between \"fun\" and \"exciting.\"\n\nI don't think it's necessarily down to the fact that I grew up driving with both hands and both feet. A while ago I got a Hyundai Kona AWD as a rental. I had a ton of fun throwing that thing around... maybe more fun than I'd ever had in my Tesla. (As Jeremy Clarkson says - the fastest car in the world is the rental car.) Coming to this tragic realization was a big red flag for me. Maybe it has something to do with the fact that, at \\~4,100 lbs, it's still a a fat-ass car, and the weight was an ever-present part of the experience? Or it starts life as a comfortable family sedan? But then again, so does the M3. I can't for sure pin it down to one thing, but at the end of the day I never really \"felt\" and enjoyed the Tesla in the same way I felt and enjoyed my '99 Miata.\n\n# Tesla and the EV community\n\nThis is the part where I rage about Tesla and will probably ruffle some feathers. Too bad.\n\nLet me start off by saying that the service center (SC) employees are generally awesome - at least the one in my local SC. Tesla's engineers are brilliant, too. And it's refreshing to see a novel approach to building a car, where all the systems are so tightly integrated that everything feels \"whole\" vs. a bunch of different fiefdoms colliding into one car at the very end. And they're truly being innovative beyond just the fact that they're making EVs - Elon's woken up to the fact that manufacturing is no joke, and it sounds like they're doing their damnedest to make strides in this area as well. I wouldn't be surprised if ultimately their innovations in manufacturing outweigh their innovations everywhere else.\n\nBut I think all of their issues stem from dog-shit, stubborn management, rushing and not thinking things through carefully, an engineering-first approach, and Elon - a guy I can respect, but could use a serious ass-kicking once or twice.\n\nTheir quality control is abhorrent - we already know that. Model Ys being delivered with windshields not bonded into place is my favorite recent example. But the materials themselves are nothing to write home about, either. It's not bargain-basement bad, but the Model 3/Y certainly do *not* feel like $45K+ cars, except to clueless new owners who are just getting interested in cars for the first time. This really hit home for me the first time I cleaned my Model 3's interior - the carpets are literally like a glorified version of glovebox liner. The lauded \"vegan leather\" seats don't seem so great, either - look up the headrest bubbling issue on the Model 3. Which is an excellent segue into the mentality of \\*some\\* Tesla fanatics.\n\nBefore we dive into this, let's be clear - The **vast** majority of owners, as usual, are just normal people who don't care. Every car brand has its own subset of narrow-minded insufferable people who will die defending it, no matter what. What makes this subset of Tesla peeps especially unbearable is that they genuinely believe that they are saving the planet and have elevated Tesla to something more of a deity than a car company. So there's this undercurrent of holiness that accompanies the entire sphere and makes the proselytizing that much more infuriating. *\"Ew, ICE engines, what a stupid design!\"* Yeah. Our civilization got to where it is on AAA batteries!\n\nBut that's easy to ignore. The copious amounts of mental gymnastics going on in the community is what's truly saddening. I remember coming across one topic where a guy with a Model X was wondering how he was going to take his family on a ski trip past a supercharger desert in the Northeast. They bought a bunch of 12V heated blankets to avoid running the heat. This is a $100K+ SUV we're talking about.\n\nI came across countless other such examples where fashionable forfeiture serves as justification for buying into a nascent technology - \"Who needs to drive more than 200 miles, anyway?\" False analogies are rampant, also - \"ICE cars overheat too!\" - often in irrelevant comparisons largely due to being an established technology. There was one guy who was worried about using the heat in the wintertime and its impact on range. Someone replied and told him that he wasn't dressing appropriately for the weather.\n\nBack to the vegan leather headrest, otherwise known as \"plastic.\" (It's hilarious watching two camps of environmentalists collide - on one end, the bovine enthusiasts. On the other, the guys thinking they're saving the planet in a $100K+ EV carrying around 1,300 lbs+ in batteries.) Something similar started happening to mine, both on driver and passenger sides. Getting it replaced under warranty is hit and miss, because Tesla. According to this vocal minority in the Tesla community, it was, of course, my fault. Not that I'd damaged it intentionally, but that \"some hair products tend to do this\" (hint: I use none) or \"some people's body oils degrade car interiors\" (hint: No car I've ever owned has exhibited this problem, ever. Wife is a completely different race from me, same issue - the fact that I even feel the need mention this is ridiculous). One guy went as far as telling me that the problem was that I was using the headrest as a headrest. OK!\n\nEV blogs like electrek and insideEVs are especially abhorrent. Even as a new owner in my honeymoon phase, I stopped reading those a few months into my ownership. Articles are not written from the perspective of \"is Tesla great?\" but rather \"how great is Tesla, exactly?\"\n\nServicing a Tesla is also an exercise in patience. A number of crucial components like batteries and drive units are \"restricted.\" As a DIYer who keeps cars for a long time, this is extremely concerning in the way of Right to Repair. Rich Rebuilds goes on about this. But the company is in no rush to build and support an ecosystem of third-party repair, beyond bullshit like rotating tires. With any other regular car, there's an army of mechanics waiting to serve you should you run into problems.\n\nFinally, the whole \"software as a car\" thing is great - up to a point. It's sort of a double-edged sword. Towards the end of my ownership, my Model 3 started developing this strange intermittent bug that wouldn't let the car go to sleep. So it would inexplicably rip through 1.5% of its battery every hour, just sitting there in the parking lot. No way to tell this was happening. I'd just get into the car the next day and see that the range had gone down considerably overnight. Seeing that issue develop and become increasingly common was very concerning, especially knowing the entropy that can accompany the software lifecycle and Tesla's QC standards. It's one thing to have a bug in your nav, it's quite another when a bug can affect its fundamental operation as A CAR. And with OTA updates, don't assume that just because something works today, it will also work tomorrow. So even though the car is absolutely brilliant in the snow, I never took it skiing, for fear of returning to not only a cold-soaked battery, but also a surprise decrease in available range.\n\nAnd let's not even get into Full Self-Driving. Anyone who thinks that **truly** self-driving cars are anywhere on this side of 50 years will be sorely disappointed. I genuinely feel for the people plopping down $10K for this feature and hope it's mere pocket change in their world.\n\nAnd the yoke? lol\n\n# It's up to you.\n\nIf the downsides that I've laid out here are within your tolerance limits, and you're willing to bear the risk of being an early adopter, nobody can fault you for going with a BEV if it fits your lifestyle and needs. The Model 3, at the end of the day, is still a fantastic car for regular daily driving, for a lot of people.\n\nDo I think this is the end of EVs for me? No. Maybe for the time being, but I think that in 15 - 20 years, there will be far more well-rounded EVs on the market - battery or otherwise. The potential benefits purely from an ownership/convenience perspective are too great to ignore. And I do think that with their skateboard design, allowing them to \"circumvent\" the pedestrian safety regulations that have absolutely ruined the aesthetics of modern cars, EVs also have the potential to make cars beautiful again.\n\nI went into my Model 3 ownership experience with an open mind, and I genuinely learned a lot and have absolutely zero regrets about my experience. But in the end, I couldn't overlook its shortcomings, as I perceived them, for one simple reason: I just never fell in love with it. For you, things might be different.\n\nHappy New Year and let the internet rage begin!",

        "content": "2022 Ford explorer titanium phev or 2018 GLS. Hi everyone,\n\nI\u2019m from the Netherlands and currently deciding between two 7-seater SUVs: the Ford Explorer PHEV and the Mercedes GLS.\n\nSome context \u2014 I come from a family of 7 (two younger sisters, parents, my wife, our daughter, and me). We go on road trips across Europe twice a year with the whole family, so I need something spacious and comfortable. At the same time, the car will also be used as a daily driver for either me or my wife, so practicality really matters.\n\nI test-drove the Ford Explorer PHEV and was pleasantly surprised. The 40 km electric-only range is great for short city trips, and the third-row legroom was actually comfortable for someone like me (I\u2019m 5\u20199\u201d). I grew up riding and driving Toyotas like the Innova and Highlander, so the Explorer felt just right \u2014 familiar and capable.\n\nBefore this, I also tried the Volvo XC90, but I found the third row really cramped and just not suitable for adults or longer trips \u2014 it was a dealbreaker for me.\n\nOn the other hand, my dad is pushing me to go for the Mercedes GLS \u2014 mainly for the brand and luxury factor. I already own a Mercedes E-Class PHEV and I do like how easy it is to drive and find an available parking spot (the ev charging ones) , especially with a baby onboard. That said, I\u2019m not sure the extra cost, size, and luxury of the GLS are really worth it for our needs.\n\nCan anyone help me with thier prior experience with these cars? \n\nFor me performance is not a priority , practicality with a subpar luxury is.",

Hi Guys, I'm looking to buy a brand new car, and i have a budget of P1M in Philippine pesos (roughly $21,000 USD). \n\nOur area sometimes gets flooded so I need a car that's higher (the height of the Toyota Innova is fine). I've also gotten used to driving the Innova, but I'm looking for a different car since my family members also have Innovas.\n\nI dont really need the extra seats since I usually only drive myself plus maybe 1-2 friends. \n\nI do need a automatic transmission though and will be primarily using the car for city driving.\n\nCan you guys help me decide? Thanks!",

I drive an Innova Hycross Hybrid, and Toyota recommends RON 95+ petrol. Regular Indian petrol is RON 91, but with 20% ethanol blending (E20) the effective octane comes out around 95+.\n\nSo if normal E20 is already 95+, is there any real advantage in paying extra for XP95 / Speed95 / Power95? Do they make a noticeable difference in performance, mileage, or engine smoothness \u2014 or is it just about additives?",

        "content": "Car ran over a dog at Teen Hath Naka ( she didn't survive ). Yes, I\u2019m aware this incident took place in Thane and I\u2019ve already shared it on the Thane subreddit. However, I\u2019m posting here as well in the hope of reaching a wider audience \u2014 to bring more attention to what happened and to seek any possible help in identifying the vehicle or driver.\n\nThis happened at exactly 11:01 PM right outside the newly opened\u00a0*Angel\u2019s Juice Center*, located on the corner of the service road (location marked on the map below). I had stepped out to get water when I saw three dogs on the road \u2014 locals later told me they were a family: a father, a mother (who sadly died), and their pup.\n\nOne of the dogs was\u00a0**peacefully sleeping, slightly in the middle of the service road**, but there was\u00a0**ample space for the car to swerve**\u00a0and pass from the side. And if not, the driver could've at least\u00a0**stopped and honked**. It would\u2019ve taken\u00a0**20 seconds of patience**, but instead, this fucker\u00a0**chose to run over the dog\u2019s neck**\u00a0without hesitation.\n\nI tried to stop the driver \u2014 he looked at me and just kept going. The woman in the passenger seat also clearly realized what had happened. They both knew they ran over the dog. It was a\u00a0**dark blue Toyota Innova Hycross**, visible in the image I managed to capture (though it's blurry, as I was running and the car was in motion).\n\nThe dog was still alive \u2014 wagging her tail and bleeding from her mouth. A few of us rushed her to an animal hospital in Bhandup (marked open on Google), but she tragically died on the way. From how badly she was injured, I don\u2019t think she had much of a chance \u2014 but we tried.\n\n# I really need help from this community.\n\nI know the image is blurry, but I managed to capture part of the number plate. It starts with\u00a0**HR (Haryana)**\u00a0and ends with\u00a0**612**.\n\n* Can anyone\u00a0**enhance the image**\u00a0or help in\u00a0**identifying the full number**?\n* Is there a way to\u00a0**track vehicle details with this much info**?\n* Can anything be done to hold the driver accountable?\n\nEven though it may be hard to take legal action, I just\u00a0**don\u2019t want this to be ignored**. This was someone\u2019s life, and it didn\u2019t deserve to end like this.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kgxi1ktp1s5f1.png?width=1149&format=png&auto=webp&s=6595819646b10746a5cacd8b65191ecf9d25cac1\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c2n5nmtp1s5f1.png?width=439&format=png&auto=webp&s=bed3c9320a0f47840dc750185da9607e01aa2416\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u8mlcotp1s5f1.jpg?width=2268&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b35aef791217925e3f0c4cfb3ab92736e83f71ab",

        "content": "OLA Postpaid Scam - Beaware. I booked Ola Mini to office today morning and I got Innova Crysta. While it felt off, I thought it was my lucky day. I called up the driver to ask him how long he would take to reach and he said 7 minutes and then asked if payment was cash or online? Now this is a question they usually ask. I told him it\u2019s online, I have Ola Postpaid.\n\nA few minutes later the driver calls me back and says his app isn\u2019t working and to send him the location from Ola app. He explained go to the app and waha pe profile ka screenshot leke share karo. Now I was legit thinking about things I need to get done today and without giving it a second thought sent him the screenshot. I didn\u2019t realise I actually sent him the ride OTP. He started the ride and ended it then and there and I got charged 160. \n\nI have no hopes from Ola support given how fuck all it is. Given the amount was only 160, I consider this as charity to a poor person. Anyway lesson learnt to have more presence of mind henceforth.",

        "content": "Minor road accident today, please advise. I've posted in r/pune too, but I need and will appreciate responses here too.. Just this afternoon in Pune, I was driving my scooter on a road, which is not crowded at all anytime otherwise, but today was full of traffic due to a local election. I had gone just one turn away from my house, and then I bumped into an Innova in front of me.. the Innova had also braked.I don't fully recall though if it was the driver's fault or mine, there was a little dent and scratch on the back plastic guard, and it was unusual bumper to bumper traffic ahead of us.\n\nDriver said he will call owner till then told me to wait. I told him I have to go somewhere, and that it's a minor thing, still I waited. When the owner came he said its too much of work, it is new vehicle etc (I looked it up online, the plastic part would be around 3-4k).\n\nThey checked my vehicle too, and found it dented, but I told him it was caused much earlier. All there was due to today's impact was a little white paint from the Innova plastic part. I had to give them my name, mobile, vehicle number, but I have the driver's number only, not the owner's.\n\nI asked the guy his name, and looked him up on fb, also checked his vehicle number on RTO site. Found that the guy is a wrestler and son of a local rural NCP politician..the types who flaunt their wealth.. and that the vehicle is registered in the father's name. \n\nIn the end I told him that I braked still it hit, I apologised many times and even told him I didn't do it purposely, had it been my fault I would have ran off right away, he said we will see..not that he threatened me in any way but I'm really tensed after discovering this info about him. Family knows nothing about this. What do you think can he do? And what should I do?",

        "content": "Great Road Trips Around Mumbai. *You will find plenty of articles online that suggest many road trips around this region but are they really that good? 15 years ago they were. But with the explosion of real estate as a speculative investment vehicle, we have lost almost all of them. Here is the reality check. I have been road tripping (and still do) around these areas for over 15 years now. I have seen the drastic fall in our scenic locations. And the reason I write this is to raise awareness that if we don't take stock of the situation, what's left will soon go as well.*\n\nAlso worth noting is that in all of these routes (on the road), it's next to impossible to find good clean Maharashtrian food. A delicious simple thali, like the one from Girija in Pune will also do. But even the food on most of these routes is shit. (except of course once you read Alibaugh/Lonavala/Mahabaleswar towns, you will find one or two nice places).\n\n**Mumbai - Lonavala** used to be a good drive. Now, till the beginning of the expressway it's kind of sad. On the expressway till the first toll booth, the road is enveloped in construction. Skyscrapers are coming up. The hills are being cut down (you can see that in Vashi itself). From the first toll booth to Lonavala is a ride up the ghats which is a slow moving heavy truck zone with thousands of vehicles struggling with their old under-powered engines in first gear creating plenty of pollution. SO this drive is over. Out.\n\nOn the old highway the story is the same. Plus add to it pedestrians, random indiscliplined two wheelers, anything goes. And speed breakers. Do not forget the speed breakers.\n\nPlus Lonavala is pretty much like Goregaon East now. Over construction, much of the green cover has been lost, traffic jams, and damn every shop selling that same shitty fake Chikki. You are better off spending your weekend in Colaba. It will be less crowded than Lonavala. Now there is even a mall and a McDonald's at Lonavala. \n\n**Mumbai- Goa** Used to be a good drive about 20 years ago. I have been here on a bike for the first time in 2002.. It was nice. I mean the route is beautiful in parts, but it is still single lane in most parts, with random diversions for two laning (or four). which has been going on forever. Being single laned, you will have an annoying slow moving vehicle in front and a restless Innova behind and no way to get ahead. I have had state buses hurl at me, in my side of the road, at full speed, only to cut left at the last minute. This highway is traumatic. And it also has one of the highest accident rates in India, I believe.\n\n**Mumbai - Mahabaleshwar** This route goes via NH4 (Mumbai Pune) crosses Pune and another probably 100km ahead. Till Lonavala the highway is non-scenic. From Lonavala till the second Toll booth, the highway has hills and forests on either side which is nice. But they are fast being degraded. If you care, please call the Pune forest division and urge them to keep grazers and forest burners out.\n\nFrom Pune till the right crossing for Mahabaleswar is shit. Full of construction, concrete, diversions, bad roads and millions of two wheelers and other traffic. There is a small ghat in between much after Katraj, which is ok, but that's only a few KM. Once you exit the NH4 and take the right to Mahabaleshwar, the road is nice only in stretches. \n\nMabaleshwar itself is over developed. Over concretised, loud and crowded. No longer the quaint secluded getaway. If I ran a resort in Mahabaleshwar, I would try and do something to immediately stop any more construction, grow more trees, and work towards reducing traffic.\n\n**Mumbai - Igatpuri** Its mostly hell. Till Kalyan-Bhiwandi you wish you had an autonomous vehicle so you could sleep it off. At Kasara, a few KM of the ghats are nice. Rest everything has been cut down for 'town ships', factories, second/third/fourth homes, and what not. This route is also not recommened.\nIgatpuri itself is a tiny dusty little over-crowded town now. If you looked hard enough you would find maybe a few old charming homes, but just for them travelling and enduring all this is not worth it.\n\n**Mumbai to Alibaugh** Most of the road is the Mumbai Goa road (read above). It is shit. You will want to run away at the enormous traffic jams and ugliness at Vadkal Naka. Once you take the right towards Alibaugh, the road becomes nice in parts though. But see concretisation everywhere.\n\n**Mumbai To Kashid** Same as Mumbai to Alibaug. Around in 2004 when I first went to Kashid and Murud Janjira, the place was awesome. It had gentky rollimng meadows on one side and the sea on the other. Now most of the beach facing land has been bought, second/third/forth houses buyilt, rest is fenced off, natural vegetaion burnt/cut to make plots for sale easier.\n\n**Mumbai to Malshej Ghat** : See Mumbai to Igatpuri. Till Kalyan the ride is shit. Once you take a right from Kalyan the route is pretty fucked up till maybe 50km or more. Kalyan town is full of speed breakers every maybe 50 metres. Too much traffic, and litter. Once you start exiting the town, there is litter on both sides and gazillions of 'real estate' projects coming up. Only much ahead, after you cross one of the first ghats does the scenery become slightly better. But large ugly stop overs are ruining what was there. Why dont people make more blended in stop overs?\n\nThis part of Maharashtra used to be gorgeous. But we have lost it. And are fast losing what's left.",

Was on my phone, so did not realize what happened, but started hearing an argument between my driver and an Innova driver. (While the cars were in motion) apparently the innova guy was triggered and was nudging us. I implored him to stop and let the guy go ahead, but no. It got scary really quick with a truck to my left and crazy guy pushing us on right. Somehow we got to the left lane where Innova hammered us and stepped out with an iron rod accompanied with wife and baby. An argument between the drivers ensured, luckily i found a rickshaw and took off from the spot. The circle of friends is split on staying around. My answer police ka lafda ya maar peet hogi toh kauh aake khilaga.",

Keep everyone stuck in traffic and worried about getting home to their families at a decent hour or even just getting home in one piece, keep the masses entertained and fattened and drunk at the thousands of pubs and fancy eateries that are continuously being granted permission to open, let them burn that fat at Cults and regain it in the evening anyway, let them be engrossed in silly IT office politics and sex scandals and antakshari and ethnic day photo ops with the HR and the struggle to feel alive at the end of the day after dealing with Excel work that nobody in their American head offices would touch with a ten-foot cattle prod and to feel important and significant despite that fancy title on your linkedin page (\"IT Evangelist | TedX Talker\" you pretentious piece of shit lol), let these people dodge dangling live wires and jump over wobbly pavement slabs covering gutters, let the potholes get wider and pavements get narrower and uneven and occupied by cigarette stalls catering to those stuck in traffic; let the frustration build up slowly in the background in everyone's head to the point where they realize that every single problem plaguing this city is inextricably interlinked and intertwined and has neither head nor tail and cannot be fixed unless the entire city's political system is purged by a replacement. \n\nAt this point everyone gives up, because they then realize that if a new political power needs to replace the existing system of JDS/BJP/Congress, they would have to start working from scratch and build reputation and gain popular support throughout the entire state over the course of several years and election terms, by which time this city will be dead.\n\nThen they wonder if it would just be enough to win Bangalore. Is it possible? Could we create a political party to win *just* Bangalore? Assuming every techie from outside the city/state and within chose to vote for only this new political party, it might stand a chance. But then, what could a handful of MPs and MLAs hope to achieve if the rest of the voting population of the state chooses to vote for those who were traditionally voted into power on the basis of their long years of experience and ground support. We'll still need new corporators/councilors/ward members from this new party to control the BBMP, but God knows when those elections will be held, *IF* they will be held at all. When they smell a competitor on the rise, one who wants to usurp their thrones for the good of the city, they'll throw their considerable financial resources into destabilizing it, nip it in the bud, stamp it out. They'll count on our inexperience and naivet\u00e9 taking over when we hit our first obstacles, making the movement stillborn. \n\nThen we wonder if we can count on our celebrated social media cult figures who have been hyped up to Keanu levels until a small, skeptical nagging voice in the back of our heads reasons that they might have their own selfish agenda. We can only hope this agenda might also, as a byproduct, serve the greater good (chorus chant *the greater good* with me). At least they're out there, eh?\n\nAnd then what, we give up.\n\nBut we're often reminded in small flashes of clarity and insanity that we outnumber these gold-wearing, Innova-lounging political snakes and all the thugs they could possibly throw at us for daring to raise a voice. We have these little flash-like fantasies where we finally, collectively grow a spine as a city and take back our power from them. \n\nBut those flashes are just flashes, they're gone just as swiftly as they come to us. \n\nWhat do i know? I'm just a non-techie boy in a techie world, who just woke up from a nightmare and can't go back to sleep, so used some half-knowledge to make a rant post on Reddit for some karma after he saw a post where the Karnataka HC called the BBMP Bangalore's Public Enemy No. 1. I think I'm just gonna go to my gym now. That fat isn't going to burn itself. I'm looking into transferring my vote here. Can't contest elections. Kannada doesn't barutth enough for me to be able to reach out to the grassroots. There, said it before some smart-ass says \"they why don't you do it ra?\"\n\nGood morning, fellow spineless bastards. Let's wake up to a new day of bending over and taking it dutifully right where the sun don't shine.",

        "content": "Personal Bengaluru Kidnap Incident . Hey Everyone,\nLet me dive straight into this tale of chaos that unfolded during what was supposed to be a carefree weekend bike ride from Bengaluru to Tamil Nadu. Picture this: three bikes cruising down the highway, laughter and camaraderie filling the air, until we decided to take a break. I stopped my bike, letting my friends continue on their journey, blissfully unaware of the storm brewing ahead.\n\nSuddenly, a horrifying clash shattered our tranquility. One of our bikers, caught off guard by the erratic braking of an Innova, collided with it. It became painfully clear that the driver was drunk, and to our dismay, he and his companions were from Tamil Nadu. Instantly, chaos erupted as a menacing group of ten emerged from the car, their intent clear. They descended upon my friends like wolves, beating them mercilessly and snatching three of them away, threatening further violence if we dared to follow.\n\nIn desperation, we raced to the nearest police station, but our hopes were dashed as the officers, more interested in lining their pockets, demanded bribes instead of offering help. Just when we thought all was lost, one of the kidnapped friends managed to call me. His voice trembled as he revealed their captors hailed from Salem and were demanding a ransom of 50,000 rupees for their release. With no other option, we reluctantly complied, sending the money via UPI, praying for their safe return.\n\nThey were released in the desolate middle of nowhere, but not without a cost; one friend returned with a broken nose, a brutal reminder of the ordeal. Fortuitously, one of the kidnapped was the son of a politician, and he vowed to escalate this matter to higher authorities to ensure justice is served. \u2696\ufe0f\n\nLet this serve as a cautionary tale: may no one else endure such a harrowing experience. I hold a deep respect for Tamil culture and its people, but the demons we encountered were a stark contrast to the warmth I know.\n\n\nDisclaimer: I did use chatGPT to rephrase sentences because I felt it would be more clear to whoever so is reading this :)",

        "content": "First day at bangalore. I have heard of the attrocities by bangalore autowalas and cab drivers so was prepared for the worst when me and my friends needed an uber xl with all our luggage for travelling about 11 kms from kr puram.  Adding to that, the driver couldn't find us for about 10-15 mins after he arrived at the station ( idk what happened here, we had the location correct and even informed him about the exact gate no of the railway station.)\n\nSo we loaded the bags and set off. Uber showed a price of 440, which is reasonable for the 4 of us with this much luggage in an innova. So we reached the place and the guy was super nice and didn't even ask for anything more. We kinda felt bad for him because of the initial finding us ordeal so gave him 20 rs more( i know it doesn't matter that much but still)\n\nSo my first experience with a cab wala in bangalore was pretty nice and I guess this shows there are good ones out there too.\n\n\nTldr : Good experience with an uber guy in bangalore. No extra rates and a nice guy too. Even when he probably knew we were in bangalore for the first time.",

Crashed with a yolo guy who literally started right next to me and started turning towards me. Crazy guy. \n2. Fucking car taxis , I tell you it's worse than any other type of driver on the road. A black innova taxi literally gave me a near death experience it was inches away when he zoomed past me at 60-70km per hour. I was driving at the left end of the road with only the steel barrier on my left side. God forbid if I was an inch left. \n3. The auto stopped in the middle of the road and decided to take a U turn. The second death experience , again on the left side and he started turning at crazy speeds had to literally put my life on the breaks.\n\nLesson learnt:-\n\n1. Driving is absolutely worst. The people who do drive the public transport are literally crazy. I am sure if they kill somebody on the road it doesn't matter to them cause that's how they drive. Obviously not all of them but in general.\n2. I am only gonna drive it around in the early morning hours and then maybe carry it back in a public transport if possible.\n3. No amount safety gear can save on you bengaluru roads. Mark my words. No amount of safety gear. So make your decisions wisely. \n\n\n\nP.S. - Just bought a new Marin gravel for travelling around bengaluru. Should have researched before.",

My uncle and aunt (68 and 71) moved out of bangalore to pune and they left with their all their stuff and cats by road yesterday evening. All of my aunts jewellery was in a bag tied to the carrier of innova on top. They stopped for tea in the evening around 7.30 and the bag was there. There was no stop made after that and aunty was awake all along. Suddenly at 4 in the morning they realise the bag is gone. Innova driver says the to booth guys sometimes pick up bags from top. But then they are already too far. They have all their luggage, cats and they are  tired with the journey. They could not spend  time going back and enquiring and they weren't hopeful of any outcome so they just went ahead. It would be worth 20L Or more. \nWhat can we done now? We don't even know where to file and FIR. \n\nP.S. pls don't ask why the bag was where it was. In the hindsight we realise it was a bad decision",

My wife and three kids will be arriving at Delhi's Indira Gandhi International Airport from the United Kingdom. Given the amount of luggage they'll have, I'm looking for a reliable taxi service that can accommodate them all. Their flight arrives early Sunday morning, and while you can get taxis at the airport, most aren't large enough for all their luggage, especially since many run on CNG and have limited trunk space. Ideally, something like an Innova would be perfect. They will be traveling to West Delhi, so I need a service that can ensure a smooth drop-off there. Where can I book a reliable taxi that\u2019s guaranteed to pick them up? Your advice would be really helpful!",

I was looking to book a cab service from Delhi Airport to Jim Corbett. I don't know if an innova or similar vehicle would hold all of us and our luggage. I came across a website called Solo cabs who offer 12 seater tempo travellers. I just wanted to know if the website is legit and if any of you have used it. Any input on this would be greatly appreciated.",

So today I was driving up a narrow steep bridge and bikers usually make reckless overtakes so I was moving a little slower than usual, and then comes a Fortuner with a flag of one of the political parties flashing his high beam constantly to make me move real fast and making aggressive moves. I never budged, and the driver finally overtook like a maniac after we got off the bridge.\n\nAny one have these experiences? \n\nAre these drivers asked to drive aggressively? Are they trying to feel important by making everyone move out of thier way by honking like retards or flashing high beams. These acts seem so childish. I remember a few years ago, a Innova driver for some political party aggresivly tried to keep up with my bike in a busy street, for which I stopped my bike and smacked the shit out of driver, who then proceeded to search his boot for a possible weapon but found none and got another smack until he left the scene in embarrassment. Im not a hot head like I used to be and I'm not interested in becoming aggressive like them no more. \n\nBut Seriously politicians should advice their drivers that they are not ambulances or fire station trucks or cops for people to move the fuck out the way when they bring thier cars.",

The types of people that I see are:\n\nWrong route/ lane people:\nTwo-wheelers who go in the opposite route/ lane as they find even a small gap. What these dumb fucks fail to realise that they are obstructing the people in the opposite side. Once, I was dropping my friend at 7 AM in the main road(the main road of Arumbakkam Megamart to be precise)and while doing so, a 20's woman comes in the opposite lane. She looks at me and shouts, \" Enga neekara, arivu illam?\" My friend in the car replied, \"Nee Vara lane correct ah??\" She could not make eye contact with any of us after that. Imagine breaking the law and having the fucking audacity to pinpoint others. Fucking imbecile\n\n\nMiddle of the road:\nWe need to study on what goes in their brain. Imagine going in the middle of the fucking road, not allowing anyone else to travel in it. I see wayyy to many cars and bikes do this. When I ask these \"high\" IQ people on why they drive live this, they reply like, \"Venuna nee chinna car vangu\". Dei dumbass, I am driving a Celerio da. If you think that is big, imagine what would their reaction be when a Innova Crysta comes in their way. Or they reply like, \"You also drive in 2 wheelers.\" Fair point. But I can't take my 80 year old grandmother in a bike, right? Hence I a car\n\n\nGoing through the gaps of severe traffic:\nWhen people are in a traffic jam situation, most of us will wait until we have space and we move. Whereas we have some fuckers who try to go in that traffic as well. As if they don't reach their destination in the next 10 minutes, they will lose 20 crores. While going in this traffic, these two-wheelers have scratched my car more than once. When I try to confront them, they literally run away. One guy literally smiled and went. As if what he did was a big achievement. Assholes.\n\nEven today, while I was going from Anna Nagar to Mogappair, a woman was going in a hurry and scratched my car. She didn't even look back. I tried chasing her but she ran away. \n\nYou might think that my rants are like that guy in Pichaikaran 1, but these are actually real things that I see almost everyday. I hope that these people learn on how to drive and how to respect other people on the road as well!",

That Innova asshole started swerving from right to left lane without indicator coz he wanted to overtake the autos mf didn't see me. Me being the defensive rider went ahead and escape these 3 maniacs. Then came AGS signal. Signal la poi nikkarom marubadiyum adaye panan he was about to hit me this time.

If not, what\u2019s a fair price for such rental car in Chennai? Can anyone suggest a good car rental company?\n\nI also wonder if in the long term, it\u2019ll be cheaper to buy the cars under company name and then just hire the drivers?",

Instead, they managed to take him to Shastri Hospital on a scooter. The girl's mother accompanied them, as her father works out of town. My friend also stepped in to pay the 10,000 admission fee to ensure immediate treatment.\n\nThe story behind the debt was tragic. The young man, an ambitious trader, had once made a 10 lakh profit in a single day. In an attempt to double it the same day, he ended up losing everything. His mother told him, \"Tyala khup lavkar motha hoycha hota\" (He wanted to grow up too fast). Over time, he sold his prized possessions, including an Innova Crysta and a Bullet bike, but the debts kept mounting. He had borrowed 30, 20 lakhs from acquaintances at a staggering 15% interest rate, which further spiraled out of control.\n\nso what do we learn?",

This happened very recently, I, 22F, went out for a drive at around 4 pm, a man in his Innova decides to overtake with no space ahead and ends up touching his rear end to my car's bumper.\n\nNothing happened (fortunately) it was just a paint transfer on a very small area, I didn't get out of car becoz it was in the middle of highway. But seeing a girl in the car he decides to jump out, stop the car and starts asking for money in the middle of the HIGHWAY.\n\nHe looked drunk, and also looked like he wasn't the owner of the car. I somehow managed to reverse and get out of there.\nBut GUESS WHAT?  This man followed me for 5-7 fucking kilometers with his wife and 4-5 year old kid in his car.\nStopped me at multiple points, overtaking me and stopping his car right in front of mine.\nGetting out of car, banging my window, trying to open the car door, creating a damn scene in the middle of the road when it was his fault.\nI was so panicked that I didn't even know what to do. Fortunately I wasn't heading home otherwise he would've known my location.\n\nIt scares the shit out of me, what if my car doors werent locked? what if it was outskirts area ? \n\nThere wasn't any traffic police in the area he followed me,that made things more scary.\n\nI have loved this city so much, but things like these have made me hate it, it just scares me that anything could happen to me anytime.",

Me and my family members are still a bit shaken about it. \n\nSo, today around 8:30pm, I had to drive my mom to some local shop in car as it was raining heavily. We had to do some shopping and also I had to buy some stuff, which took at least around an hour, 20mins or so. \n\nWhile returning, which was around 9:50pm, we had to take a turn around the road going from the Sai chowk, main road (where the dolphin statue used to be) to the Sutarwadi road. We had to take a left turn into a road and I was just going to take it .... when this car, doing about a 100, on that road came out of nowhere. I think it passed us ONLY BY A COUPLE OF INCHES. We watched it whiz passed us, and then some distance ahead, it started doing a weird erratic driving from left to right, and was about to crash into the middle road separator. Suddenly it swerved right and disappeared into Sutarwadi. \n\nIt was clear that the driver was drunk driving. \n\nI didnt get a clear look at the license plate, which I kind of regret, but I don't think it would have helped a lot. The car was a silver Innova. \n\nWe are all a little shaken, because the car at that speed would have been a sure death of all of those in both the cars. Following the Porche case, even had the driver survived, there would have been no repercussions. Police is useless here, there is no law and order.\n\nTbh its a little of my fault too, going out at such a late hour. Wont be doing that again. I am just shocked people drink so close to festival season here. I have a little brother at home and my mom was also with me, I guess I got really lucky.\n\nPlease take what happened, and maintain caution while going outside, especially at night. It is not safe anywhere.",

He had risen from very poor background and worked really hard to become a good father and husband. His wife is struggling in ICU with Spo2 of 60 and Doctors have given up on her and she can pass away any moment. His son and daughter were struggling to get remdesivir injection and oxygen but could get none. Despite being a well to do person with money to buy required medicines, he had to die a neglected death.\n\nDoctors are either overwhelmed or just dont care anymore. Nobody from patients family can go in, and one can only wonder how much care will be given to a patient inside overloaded hospitals.\n\nConditions are very very bad out there. I am unable to hold back my tears at the thought of the kids losing both their parents on the same day - unable to do anything. We middle class people cant even use our savings to buy injections and oxygen for the loved ones.\n\nThese two will become just another number in the long list of covid related deaths. Lives are getting destroyed but that will not be felt by the corrupt and careless politicians who wasted an entire year doing nothing. CMO Maharashtra is busy securing his child's future as a minister at the expense of state's population. why were the beds and health infra not bolstered during the year. Why didn't the highly educated IAS officers take care of upcoming remdesivir situation.\n\nIts the feeling of helplessness - not being able to do anything and just waiting for somebody to die. Why work hard, pay taxes, follow rules - when ultimately the system is going to betray us.\n\nIs it a common man's fate to die like this? .. This is not acceptable.. this whole system sucks...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: There is no political angle to this post. It is against the system which has failed us common people. BJP is also at fault for not ramping up oxygen, remdesivir production, shutting down hospitals etc. \n\nFrustration is because these people purchase new fortuners/innovas for all corporators, MLAs, MPs etc after every election - but dont have the basic decency of using tax payer money to beef up basic amenities for citizens. They get to go to AIIMS, foreign hospitals for their illnesses but we have to rot and die in the sh\\*thole they have left for us...",

        "content": "Almost ended up dying twice in 'ONE' day. Hey all. I love Pune but it is becoming very hard to still be in love with this wonderful city cause of a few reasons.\n\n  \n1. I was on the highway, and took the exit at Suncity Rd and a car was merging from the left but there was sufficient space for them to merge and for me to continue without stopping, so I continued and suddenly an Innova driver came up to my right and scraped my 2W bit, fortunately it touched the bodyguard and did not do any damage. I got a bit scared as if I had been a bit to the right, they would have easily dashed into me. I was in the left lane while they were in the right lane going in the same direction as me (totally wrong side). I honked at them and they did not even look back, then I saw them being busy chatting on their phone. I gave up and continued my journey.\n\n  \n2. While coming back home, on the Sinhgad Clg road, I was riding safely and all of a sudden a swift came at me from the left, luckily I had enough time (and space as no vehicle in the opposite lane and no-one behind me) to react and swerved to the right to avoid a collision. Once again, I checked what the driver is doing and saw they are busy chatting with their friends / relatives in the car. \n\n\n\n3, If you complain about them being wrong, get ready to get beaten up or something. At this point, I feel hopeless in the law & order as well as civic sense of this city.\n\n\n\n4. Auto drivers try their best to rip you off. If you use Uber, many times they will rant about how Uber takes some commission, but if you try going direct, they do not want to go unless you pay 2.5 times of the usual fare. \n\n  \n5. The roads are real bad with no real markings on speed-breakers. Kuthe sulta speedbreaker tar kadhi ulta !\n\n\n\nI have been to many cities, and yes, I am not going to say that this is something which only happens in Pune, but lately such incidents have been happening a lot. Many of my friends and relatives also complain to me about similar experiences. I find it somewhat of a relief when I drive / ride in other cities.\n\nI still love this city but we need to figure out the above. I really hope that we figure it out someday.\n\nEnd of rant. Thank you!",

Just this afternoon, I was driving my scooter on a road, which is not crowded at all anytime otherwise, but today was full of traffic due to a local election. I had gone just one turn away from my house, and then I bumped into an Innova in front of me.. the Innova had also braked.I don't fully recall though if it was the driver's fault or mine, there was a little dent and scratch on the back plastic guard, and it was unusual bumper to bumper traffic ahead of us.\n\nDriver said he will call owner till then told me to wait. I told him I have to go somewhere, and that it's a minor thing, still I waited. When the owner came he said its too much of work, it is new vehicle etc (I looked it up online, the plastic part would be around 3-4k).\n\nThey checked my vehicle too, and found it dented, but I told him it was caused much earlier. All there was due to today's impact was a little white paint from the Innova plastic part.\n\nI had to give them my name, mobile, vehicle number, where I live approximately, but I have the driver's number only, not the owner's.\n\nI asked the guy his name, and looked him up on fb, also checked his vehicle number on RTO site. Found that the guy is a wrestler and son of a local rural NCP politician..the types who flaunt their wealth.. and that the vehicle is registered in the father's name. \n\nIn the end I told him that I braked still it hit, I apologised many times and even told him I didn't do it purposely, had it been my fault I would have ran off right away, he said we will see..not that he threatened me in any way but I'm really tensed after discovering this info about him. Family knows nothing about this. What do you think can he do? And what should I do?",

So we have around 100+ bigha of farming land in Assam which is maybe like 13+ hector (not sure of the maths) but it's completely useless, we do paddy farming once a year, that too due to lack of available labour or resources we have to give it to someone else who in turn will return us around 25% of the profit if the yield is good. We just get enough rice to feed our family of 6 people the whole year and maybe some extra to sell and earn around 30/40k\n\nI want to innovate and do some radical faming like atleast 3 crops a year if possible, vegetables, flowers etc what ever may be feasible, but to do that here are my issues.\n\n1. Lack of labour force( most people migrate to south states to do manual labour as they feel ashamed to do such things here) \n\n2. No capital to avail high tech or farming machines, or any sort of innovation.\n\n3. Parents and others say \"kheti karne ke lia degree Lia ho ka\" but mom understands and supports but can't do much.\n\nSo I was wondering if someone would help me out and guide something or even wanna get involved in some sort of partnership etc to take me to a next level of farming experience will be a great learning experience.",

Went to Tzaneen at Magoebaskloof Mountain Lodge some time back so I recognised the road and it brought back some really good memories. The fuel efficiency is not good but it is not bad either. The price is also ok cause you get quite some car for your money. I also did not like the rear design but that's a small complaint really.\n\nThanks for this subscribers special.

You can pick these up in the second market for almost R50k to R70k less than what you would be paying for a brand new one. \n\nRide quality and interior quality of the \"L\" model is pretty good. There are quite a lot of plastic trims in the second and third rows but I wouldn't make too much fuss about it. \n\n\"L\" model comes with a lot features like adaptive cruise control and the 360\u00b0 camera, which makes it easier for day to day use of the vehicle. The camera is a must since this vehicle is quite big. The camera quality is also crisp and clear. The infotainment screen is amazing. There's no lag especially if you are using Android Auto...Google Maps are very clear and easily usable. \n\nThat engine is really something. It packs a lot of punch. Also it's very responsive and to an extend fun to drive. But since it's an SUV, there is a fair amount of body roll. The engine makes you want to drive this is as if it is a 3 series or a hot hatch but if you have a family in there, they won't like that at all. \n\nNegatives:\nThe Sony sound system in the \"L\" is ok. It does a fairly ok job but it is not the usual Sony quality you would expect. Another grip I have with the XUV700 is the lack of a proper blindspot monitoring system. I was happy with the old school mirror check. But what the \"L\" model does is whenever you turn, you get a camera feed pop up in your instrument cluster from the side mirror cameras. I feel this is a bit gimmicky and would prefer the tried and test BSM indicator in the side mirrors. Fuel consumption seems to be quite horrible. It seems like this SUV averages around over 10L/100km, which is quite ridiculous. The last gripe I have with this SUV is the lack of a load cover fitted directly from the manufacturer. So if you go shopping and decide to drop the last row seats, your shopping items can be seen through the back windows.  Haval H6 and Tiggo 8 Pro come with a load cover. In SA, a load cover is a must and Mahindra must make a plan for this to be installed on all the XUV700. I mean if you going to work, you need a space to put your laptop hidden. \n\nBut otherwise this is an amazing SUV. I would suggest finding the \"L\" model in the second hand market. Some of them come with additional extras such as side steps, tow bar, protective matte film over the large infotainment screen (this does help reduce glares and keeps the screen clean to an extent). To be honest, I would probably pick AX7 L over Haval H6, Chery Tiggo 8 Pro and even some of the mainstream competitions from Toyota and VW.",

I drive the 2019 XUV500 W10, it is a wonderful vehicle for the price I bought it for brand new. I fell in love with the quirky exterior shape. After driving it for a while I discovered many other quirks such as: the infotainment screen, controls for lighting (driving lights, high beam and so on) and a lazy 4 gear. The car is enjoyable to drive, well balanced in curves and has a strong 2.2L diesel engine. I am very happy with the car. Take care",

The memory for seat adjustment. --> It works with a single click of the button if done before switching the car on. Once Car is turned on, it requires long press.\n2. FRP material(is very strong) is used for tail gate door, which is quite common in high end German cars like BMW as well.\n3. The Automatic engine on/off on complete stop of car is actually quite intelligent. It doesn't switch off the engine if there are immediate consecutive stops(as in very tight bumper to bumper slow moving traffic) in very short distance. That is why it doesn't turn the engine on during the when you try to disable the feature when engine is in off state. But i agree this could have been better.",

        "content": "Sir,\n\nI currently own a 2016 Brezza ZDi MT, which has served me well as a reliable, no-nonsense car. It's a BS4 diesel, so I\u2019ve never really had to deal with DPF issues or the complexities of BS6 tech. The Brezza gives me an average of 16 kmpl and is mostly used for local runs.\n\nNow, I\u2019m looking for a secondary car mainly for weekend getaways and long tours. I\u2019ve narrowed it down to the XUV700, as it ticks almost all the boxes for me. Honestly, the features are almost the same as what I\u2019ve been using with the Brezza \u2014 just the bare minimum that I\u2019m comfortable with. The XUV700's comfort and long-distance capability seem perfect for what I need.\n\nThe real dilemma is choosing between the petrol and diesel variants. I know the diesel has that great torque and efficiency, but my main concern is the DPF issues with BS6 diesels. Since my Brezza was a BS4 car, I never had to worry about DPF clogging or needing to do long highway runs just to clear it out.\n\nConsidering my Brezza is MT and mainly used for local runs, I\u2019m wondering if the XUV700 MX Petrol MT would be a good option to avoid potential DPF headaches. I know the petrol variant might not match the diesel\u2019s fuel efficiency, but given my primary usage, it seems practical.\n\nSo, for those who own an XUV700 (or similar BS6 diesel cars) \u2014 how bad are the DPF issues, really? Is it something that can be managed with proper usage, or should I just go for the petrol to avoid potential headaches?\n\nAny insights would be greatly appreciated!",

In these years I have had the disc pads replaced , hub bearings replaced ,  finally a suspension overall at 170,000 km. Even the clutch is fine so far since my clutch usage is a minimum and even in stop-go traffic, I prefer to quickly shift to neutral as much as possible and clutches in all my car last a very long time. I have been all over India from Ladakh to Kanyakumari and Dwarka to Arunachal. Just recently I did a trip from Thane to Pench taking the Samruddhi highway taking a flat 11 hours net. The car has been faultless to fault and has never ever given even a small problem in all my travels. Before this I had a 2002 Scorpio ( the initial lot ) and it was faultlessly reliable as well. I plan to keep the XUV for the full 15 years and then probably buy a ScorpioN. Yes, Toyota is faultlessly good, but they are hopelessly overpriced now and the others are catching up. So to doubt if the XUV 700 will last 10 years is in my opinion completely unfounded. Point is , will you save all that extra money that you pay for a Toyota ( XUV 700 or the Scorpio N is almost half the price of a Fortuner ) on maintenance cost in a 10 year period ? I will say no way.",

I was driving on highway and had to slowdown as per my on going traffic, an alto came and hit from behind, which literally for the sound and jerk felt inside  car  made me felt heartbroken assuming  shattered glass and broken bumper , but to my surprise when I got down and checked the car, it was unbelievable  for me to see everything  intact, no broken glass or bumper only an ant size paint scratch.  Hats off to mahindra. Wonderfull built quality,  this accident really proved me what magic fibre dicky doors make.",

Replaced clutch 4 times, suspension is gone..many widgets are not working..start stop, rain sensing wipers, cd player, USB port and ESP stopped working in 2 years. Service couldn't fix it. Now airbags and one more alert keeps showing up constantly. While XUV 700 looks, feels and sounds great ..am not upgrading to it. It just won't last long.",

In these years I have had the disc pads replaced , hub bearings replaced ,  finally a suspension overall at 170,000 km. Even the clutch is fine so far since my clutch usage is a minimum and even in stop-go traffic, I prefer to quickly shift to neutral as much as possible and clutches in all my car last a very long time. I have been all over India from Ladakh to Kanyakumari and Dwarka to Arunachal. Just recently I did a trip from Thane to Pench taking the Samruddhi highway taking a flat 11 hours net. The car has been faultless to fault and has never ever given even a small problem in all my travels. Before this I had a 2002 Scorpio ( the initial lot ) and it was faultlessly reliable as well. I plan to keep the XUV for the full 15 years and then probably buy a ScorpioN. Yes, Toyota is faultlessly good, but they are hopelessly overpriced now and the others are catching up. So to doubt if the XUV 700 will last 10 years is in my opinion completely unfounded. Point is , will you save all that extra money that you pay for a Toyota ( XUV 700 or the Scorpio N is almost half the price of a Fortuner ) on maintenance cost in a 10 year period ? I will say no way.",

I was driving on highway and had to slowdown as per my on going traffic, an alto came and hit from behind, which literally for the sound and jerk felt inside  car  made me felt heartbroken assuming  shattered glass and broken bumper , but to my surprise when I got down and checked the car, it was unbelievable  for me to see everything  intact, no broken glass or bumper only an ant size paint scratch.  Hats off to mahindra. Wonderfull built quality,  this accident really proved me what magic fibre dicky doors make.",

Replaced clutch 4 times, suspension is gone..many widgets are not working..start stop, rain sensing wipers, cd player, USB port and ESP stopped working in 2 years. Service couldn't fix it. Now airbags and one more alert keeps showing up constantly. While XUV 700 looks, feels and sounds great ..am not upgrading to it. It just won't last long.",

In 15 days I have completed 4500 kms. That too in peak monsoon, heavy duty rains across India. Amazing vehicle, great engine, wonderful steering, comfortable suspension and inspiring braking. The fuel average is 17.5 kmpl (at 110 - 120 kmph). At 80-90 kmph it gives 19.5-20 kmpl. It is right there with the best of the best. Very good and compelling vehicle. A Tucson would be even more refined levels. My other two cars are Mercedes E220D and Ford Endevour 3.2",

You need to have a second car in your garrage if you are going for xuv700 petrol otherwise be ready to drive a fuel guzzler. Alcazar pre-facelift model clocks 9-10 in city and 15-17 on highways. Yes, its less powerful than xuv700, why would you even compare a 1.5 with 2 and 2.2l engine??? If you are looking for a spacious 5 seater which has a 500+ litre bootspace then book a Alcazar 7 seater, as its a known fact that last row is only made for kids not for adults.",

I bought this variant because it was the only one which was offered with bench seat(2nd row) in diesel automatic. The engine is very refined, smooth and relaxed as long as you are gentle with the accelerator, push hard and it will be a disappointment. It can do high triple digit speeds but at a slower pace.\n\nIts a good car for 4 people. The 2nd row cannot accomadate a 3rd person and if you want use the 3rd row the 1st and 2nd row needs to move forward and everyone will have to sacrifice leg room.\n\nSunroof switch has two stage pull, it half click and just the shade opens, pull it all the way and sunroof opens too. If you press the button in, it opens the shade and lifts the sunroof just one step without opening it all the way.",

We are more than satisfied with the space even on the last row of the seats also, with the manual transmission, with the lighting, comfort as well as the sound insulation of the car. The bose speakers are more than what we need and cater all our needs in a long journey. Traction control system works really very well. All in all, it's an all rounder for us!

The fuel average is 17.5 kmpl (at 110 - 120 kmph). At 80-90 kmph it gives 19.5-20 kmpl. It is right there with the best of the best. Very good and compelling vehicle.

Those who bought in first 6 months of launch are lucky, all others it's too costly especially for top model\nMG hector plus - mileage is 5kmpl in city\nAlcazar - this is jack of all trades, you have power(thanks to turbo), you have features, safety is decent because they offer 6 airbags, 360 camera, front and back sensors.

So hats off to hyundai for its diverse service network\u2026and as for safety i have another story from my childhood..we owned a 2007 hyundai tucson the old one and my father had a crash in it at the speed of 100 and he survived with minor scratches now i don\u2019t know weather it was luck or something else but i trust hyundai cars.",

I chose it after comprehensively test driving Tata Harrier, Kia Seltos and Hyundai Creta.\nI love the power of the Alcazar. I drive a lot in the mountains and the sports mode is a real life saver. Power delivery is same like all other suvs I tested as Alcazar is lighter. Harrier is the heaviest and I didn't like the heavy steering in the city. Its very tiring. Also the MID sucks in Tata vehicles. I own an Altroz and I know. \nKia Seltos has a good 360 degree camera but lacks many features which are in Alcazar.\nCreta is amazing and essentially is the same car as Kia Seltos with a redesign. I loved the more premium interior in Creta but paying little bit more I got the Grand Creta which is called Alcazar in India. \nI love Alcazar as its boot space is huge with the last row folded down completely. I use Alcazar as a 5 seater. \nBest thing I love about Alcazar is the automatic torque converter diesel engine. Nobody can match Hyundai's level of smoothness. It feels like driving a petrol car. I even considered Jeep Compass but the premiumness and gadgets of Alcazar really impressed me. \nI did a short speed test and I couldn't get a chance to go beyond 176 kmph as there were vehicles in front of me. \nI always drive in sports mode and I just love it. In mountain roads while going uphill with 4 adults, a big dog and luggages, I loved the smooth acceleration. Its so effortless. Really happy with this amazing powerful engine.",

I bought this variant because it was the only one which was offered with bench seat(2nd row) in diesel automatic. The engine is very refined, smooth and relaxed as long as you are gentle with the accelerator, push hard and it will be a disappointment. It can do high triple digit speeds but at a slower pace.\n\nIts a good car for 4 people. The 2nd row cannot accomadate a 3rd person and if you want use the 3rd row the 1st and 2nd row needs to move forward and everyone will have to sacrifice leg room.\n\nSunroof switch has two stage pull, it half click and just the shade opens, pull it all the way and sunroof opens too. If you press the button in, it opens the shade and lifts the sunroof just one step without opening it all the way.",

The fuel average is 17.5 kmpl (at 110 - 120 kmph). At 80-90 kmph it gives 19.5-20 kmpl. It is right there with the best of the best. Very good and compelling vehicle.

When the car is running slow, the automatic transmission continues to \u201cautomatically\u201d try to keep the car in the appropriate gear for the speed. It causes the engine RPMs to increase - i.e. more than what we keep in manual cars. So yes, alcazar revs a bit in low gears but i don't feel the lag.",

Nonetheless the Alcazar gave me a a mileage of 14 - 15 with AC on at 23 at 80%of the time. All in all butter smooth ride quality, gearbox and the 360 camera just aids in the drive.",

During the 12 day tour with AC on continuously at 21 to 23 degrees through highways, traffic jams and very bad roads I got an average of about 16 Kmpl. During return through Yamuna Expressway and Agra Lucknow Expressway, I got an unbelievable average of about 24 Kmpl using Cruise Control at about 85 Kmph.for quite a while. The  car never felt underpowered with all the load and went up some steep gradients quite easily. The highest speed we drove at sometimes was about 140Kmph. This is my practical experience, the car is an ideal family car and is no way underpowered. I am very satisfied.",

I bought this variant because it was the only one which was offered with bench seat(2nd row) in diesel automatic. The engine is very refined, smooth and relaxed as long as you are gentle with the accelerator, push hard and it will be a disappointment. It can do high triple digit speeds but at a slower pace.\n\nIts a good car for 4 people. The 2nd row cannot accomadate a 3rd person and if you want use the 3rd row the 1st and 2nd row needs to move forward and everyone will have to sacrifice leg room.\n\nSunroof switch has two stage pull, it half click and just the shade opens, pull it all the way and sunroof opens too. If you press the button in, it opens the shade and lifts the sunroof just one step without opening it all the way.",

        "content": "Main selling point of the Innova is engine power. It is the most powerful MPV in the country. Displacement makes all the difference. It is essentially a tamed pick-up, tuning wise. 1.5 turbocharged engines can come close but not quite. \n\nBUT I find Toyota pricing a bit steep for what they're offering. Of course some safety tech is important like numerous airbags, but those tech, you don't use everyday (or don't want to use for that matter as it equates to accidents). The tech used daily though are just lacking. 6.7\" touchscreen? No backup camera for the mid-tier variant? At 1.4M, that should've been standard. The top-tier is what, 1.8M? \n\nThe \"It's a Toyota\" monicker will go old soon if they don't try to up their game. At those pricepoints, what will stop people from getting a Geely, a Tiggo, or a Maxus that offer state-of-the-art tech and similar safety features, plus ridiculous warranties? Or cheaper 7-seater options from other Japanese brands with more tech? Parts availability? It has come to a point now that all major Japanese, Korean, and even Chinese car brands have parts available everywhere, even at Shopee, believe it or not. It's not exclusive to Toyota anymore. \n\nI am not a Toyota hater. My family's first car is an old Corona. My father is now driving an old Toyota. It is always a brand that's close to my heart. But looking at it objectively, they now need to take a look at their value proposition. Knowing Toyota, they probably would in the next couple of years. Let's keep our fingers crossed.",

Who cares about all the electronic toys that will probably break, when you get this kind of power and torque and seating capacity? Like I've heard it said before, this is a no-brainer. Easy to maintain, parts and engine shared with both the Fortuner and the Hilux. Rear wheel drive and ladder frame chassis to handle loads. You can't go wrong. The smaller engined Toyota MPVs are built to a price, with lower body strength and worse NVH, so they can add heaps of electronic toys. The Innova XE A/T is the best choice for a family car.",

Easy to maintain, parts and engine shared with both the Fortuner and the Hilux. Rear wheel drive and ladder frame chassis to handle loads. You can't go wrong. The smaller engined Toyota MPVs are built to a price, with lower body strength and worse NVH, so they can add heaps of electronic toys. The Innova XE A/T is the best choice for a family car.",

Definitely its the best SUV out there if its compared with Harrier, Safari or XUV 700. This is the best vehicle offering the premium feel with best in class features at this price range. It has a linear power and has never let me down in terms of acceleration and overtaking. This is a Family oriented SUV which delivers shear pleasure and feel of premiumness which you expect from high end cars like Merc etc. I genuinely want to request people not to share fake opinions about this car. First Drive it, feel the experience and then comment. Aur agar mileage ki baat hai toh ye range me baki saari gadiyan itna hi dete hain. Difference is how you drive the car. I personally get 11-12 kmpl in city and 13-15 kmpl on highways. So way of driving matters. Hope this helps. \u270c\ufe0f",
