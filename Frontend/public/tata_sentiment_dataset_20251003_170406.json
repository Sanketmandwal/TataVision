I feel like the YouTubers are forced to bias their opinion to satisfy their hornet subscribers with their desi-love bullshit. All I want to know is which is the better product period.\n\n[Samples](https://i.imgur.com/xP4Mgyi.jpg)",

He told me that I have won a Tata Safari worth ₹12 lakh and 80 thousand because of some flipkart contest and I can either have the Car or the money wired to me. For the former, he asked me to submit ₹10 thousand in a bank account. And for the former, he asked me to mail the scanned copies of my Pan Card, Bank Passbook and a cancelled cheque.\n\nEverything was literal red alarm. I told him the blunt truth that I knew he was a scamster who's trying to thug money from innocent people. After this, he started making excuses that the prize and the contest is legitimate. I did not budge and he started abusing me. I cut the call after that.\n\nI ordered something from flipkart a few days ago and it was not delivered, all thanks to a shitty courier service. I think the delivery boys are selling consumer's contact details to these shady third parties.",

This achievement highlights the growing adoption of EVs among Indian consumers.\n\nA key factor is the lower operating cost of the Punch EV compared to its petrol variant. For example, a full charge of the 25 kWh battery providing 315 km range costs around ₹200, while the petrol Punch requires approximately ₹1,670 worth of fuel to cover the same distance.\n\nThe Punch EV's sales success signifies increasing consumer awareness about the environmental benefits of zero-emission electric mobility. EVs can potentially reduce air pollution levels, which remain a major health concern across Indian cities.\n\nWhile the Punch EV has a higher upfront price than petrol models, its running costs and eco-friendly nature appear to resonate with buyers. As EV adoption grows, it could contribute to India's sustainability goals and efforts to mitigate climate change impacts.",

Guys, I m on a dilemma, Sitting on the fence to buy a new car.\n\nHere's the thing..\n\nMy car is nearing the tenth year. Driven 1.02 Lakh kms, a diesel ford figo 1st gen.The car has been very reliablez timely services, except a major injector failure which shot my purse and post that it has been trouble free ever since.Though i would love to run the car, the car is already depreciated rapidly and due to fords exit, resale is almost nil.Due to the age and kms run, i feel resale is not going to fetch much of a money.\n\nThought of buying a car , but i do have an existing home loan with 10 lakhs as balance, which i m hopeful of completing it next year.\n\nBut with the upgrade itch starting, i was infact looking for options to upgrade ,but somehow felt that the home loan has to be finished first.\n\nOff late due to low interest rates for car loans, i m really thinking to purchase a car with such low interest rate as car prices are also being increased steadily.\n\nA hatchback of the same size today costs upwards of 10 lakhs on road.\n\nI do like to drive diesels much as my yearly run is almost 10k kms.Wanted an automatic too and hence looked at seltos diesel AT and now couldn't resist adding harrier to the list as well. As this is the only time i could buy and after this i might have several expenses upcoming like childs education etc, couldn't resist the temptation.\n\nI ll keep the car for ten years minimum and wont change it in between no matter what the advancements are \n\n \nI dilligently invest 50k per year for NPS and 20k across mutual funds and 3000 per month in PPF after all my payments like EMI, ETC ETC..I also maintain a reserve corpus of 3 months salary  which is not touched at all.\n\nWithout touching the above investments I can put a downpayment of 5 lakhs and rest on loan. Seltos means 16 lakhs OTR, harrier means 20 lakhs OTR.\n\nYearly maintenance, insurance etc is an another fixed expense i will definitely incur and considering all this, does it make sense to buy on a loan? I would really love to own a big car atleast once as i worked my a** off to pay this home loan in 5 years than the usual tenure of 10 years and would like to really treat myself with one good car..\n\nFellow redditors - Help me out..Knock me some sense if i m way too overambitious on spending 20 lakhs for a car 🙄🙄🙄🙄",

Ideally I'd be penny pinching, but I want to make sure my parents move out and about in an SUV and that's a dream I've wanted to fulfil for a long time. \n\nLooking at safety and value, I'm eyeing Harrier and Safari. The Safari last row could be useful if we went out with our dog (we can put the seats down and turn on the AC in the last row) so the dog is comfortable. \n\nBut my knowledge on cars and what to look out for isn't the best. Are there better options in this budget range?\n\nWhat do you wish you knew before buying an SUV? What advice do you have for a first time buyer?",

Hi everyone,\n\nI’ve been facing multiple unresolved issues with my Tata Curvv EV A55+ for the past 7–8 months, and Tata’s service has been extremely disappointing.\n\nProblems:\n\t\n•\tDRL Issue: One or the other side turns off randomly. Service center keeps saying it’ll be fixed via software update — still no fix.\n\t\n•\tHorn Gets Stuck: I’ve had to disconnect the small battery to stop it — happens regularly.\n\t\n•\tTyre Pressure Sensor Faulty: Shows wrong tyre readings, which is a safety concern.\n\t\n•\tAC Issue Ignored: Reported during free service — they denied it. After warranty ended, they acknowledged it and charged me for air filter replacement.\n\n\nDespite repeated visits, none of this has been permanently resolved. Tata just gives vague promises and blames software updates.\n\nI’m planning to file a consumer court complaint soon. Anyone else facing similar problems or taken legal action? Would love your input.\n\nTL;DR: Tata Curvv EV A55+ has major issues (DRL, horn, TPMS, AC), and Tata isn’t fixing them. Frustrated and going legal.",

My apologies, I have been sitting on this rant for quite some time so please bear with me.\n\nI was looking at reviews of the Tata Harrier on YouTube and a video addressed a few cheapskate moves by Tata to bring the cost down by using shit quality interior lights, using shared grab handles of the cheaper tata hatchbacks, non-alignment of panels and exterior body cuts, inferior quality of the materials used etc.\n\nNow I'm fully aware that a few cost-cuts were necessary to bring it around the 15L price bracket in order to appeal the cost-over-quality market under this price segment but these were the little things costing a few thousand bucks and shoddy craftsmanship where they cut the corners. \n\nPeople commented shit like \"logo ko apne daesh ki cheezo mei nuks nikaalna hai, bahar ki nai, Tata ki gadiyan apne Indian army mei use karte hai, bahar nikalja India se saale\".\n\nI despise illiterate shits like these who bring everything down to nationalism. It's the small things that matter which Indian manufacturers totally ignore to simply get the prices down a little bit and earn a benevolent amount of profit. Majority of the people despite obviously wanting a cheaper product won't mind shelling off a little extra to get their money's worth, especially if already paying a few lacs. Either be it Indian phones or cars, manufacturers prioritise cheap shit over quality and craftsmanship and that's a fact. Imbeciles like these defend their products and the manufacturers have gotten accustomed of delivering inferior standard of quality. With this malpractice, majority of our products don't stand anywhere (in comparison) in the international market.",

We have made jet planes, tanks , trucks etc but we can't make a sports car?\n\nNot talking about proper sportscar like ferrari,  Lamborghini or Porsche \n\nBut a mass market sportscar like mustang or corvette \n\nDC made avanti but was not worth the money \nIt made same power as bmw 3 series 2012 model so why buy a impractical sportscar instead of full sedan? Forget about bad interiors and driving dynamics \n\nTata can make engines with Cummins for their truck but can't make a 2L engine for safari and harrier \n\nMahindra can make military vehicles but can't make a small sportscar? \n\nMahindra has 2L mstallion engine which produces 200bhp and can be used for mass market decent sportscar\n\nIt's not about price as market is evolved and if people can spend 25 lakhs on pseudo suv like harrier then they'll buy a sedan too\n\nA 200bhp sedan at 25 lakhs would be steal deal when Mercedes A class has 140bhp at 55lakh\n\nSo what's the reason they can't even make mass market small sportscar?",

After the winning design is selected, the private shipyard will construct two LPDs and the remaining two will be constructed by state-owned Hindustan Shipyard Ltd (HSL). Later it was decided to give the entire LPD contract to private players upon acceptance of their revised bids.After years of delay, on 21 May 2017 Ministry Defense gave \"In-principle approval\" for the project.\n\n\nDCNS/Armaris's contender is a modified version of the Mistral Class ship. The ships in this class are generally able to carry around 900 armed troops and 16 heavy or 35 light helicopters. France's DCNS is currently India’s shipbuilding partner for its new Scorpène class diesel electric fast attack submarines.

I've already compiled a list of [places and a path](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1VM3WsFAQAjup0y_tPwUJDESTGzftCDX_&usp=sharing). I'm more interested in culture, people, historic architecture and nature. \n\n\nI've been to India twice. Once Tamil Nadu, then Northeast India. I agree, this schedule is tight. This is only a preliminary list of all interesting places I could find. I'll be cutting down places and adding more places which are close to the cities I visit. Also, I love hectic schedules, they make me feel alive. Once I did 2000 km in 8 days in hike, buses, trains, bicycle and boats in my home country. I enjoy the journey as much as the destinations. Plus, I'm okay with sleeping in the trains between states. I'm hoping that might save some time (and money).\n\nI travel for historic architecture, natural scenaries, local food, people and their culture. So, recommend me on these as well!\n\nSome questions\n\n1. What do you think of the (overall) route shown in the map? Agra-North-Rajastan-Karnataka-Kerala? Do you recommend to go Agra-Rajastan-North-South?\n\n\n2. I have added many national parks (Corbett and others). National parks are generally expensive for foreigners in terms of money as well as time. At the first glance most of these look the same to me. What do recommend to drop among those? Booking a safari in one or two of national parks to see Tigers and any beautiful vistas would do for me.\n\n\n3. Jammu Kashmir. How safe is it to go there? Regular transport is available? How are Jammu, Kashmir and Leh different from Manali, Solang valley, Spiti valley?\n\n\n4. Please recommend me any lesser-known places.",

Kindly tell me how they differ from each other and which are the MUST-GOs. Feel free to recommend me new ones as well. I am more keen on going on a safari and seeing these animals (not found in Sri Lanka) in their natural habitats.\n\n1. Corbett Tiger Reserve\n2. Gir National Park\n3.

      "content": "Why has the state of Gujarat been allowed to hold out on the translocation of Asiatic Lions?. I was recently listening to a wildlife podcast that hosted Dr.Ravi Chellam; a preeminent personality in Lion conservation when I learnt that the project of translocation of the Lion is almost three decades old. The Wildlife Institute of India (autonomous conservation institute under the umbrella of the GOI) had recommended back then that a small subset of Gir Lion population should be relocated to a former Lion habitat as far away from Gir as possible to mitigate the risks of an epidemic. I think most of us are aware of the more recent events in this regard, but I’ll recap just for completeness:\n\n1990 - First recommendation from WII for translocation\n\n\n1993 - PHVA report finds Kuno to be the most suitable site\n\n\n2003 - Human villages (comprising roughly 1545 families) in Kuno relocated to prevent man-lion conflicts\n\n\n2004 - Gujarat government refuses to release the Lions to Madhya Pradesh\n\n\n2007 - Kuno habitat certified as ready to receive Lions\n\n\n2013 - The Supreme Court rules against Gujarat, and orders that the translocation be completed within 6 months\n\n\n2015 - The Union government revises the requirements of the habitat in Kuno. Madhya Pradesh government refuses to undertake further change as that would mean more relocation of human populations. Finally, the Union government also adjourns the translocation to Kuno under safety considerations.\n\n\n2020 - PM announced a few new potential sites for translocation under Project Lion.\n\n\nNow, I would love to make my point keeping politics aside, and I will try to keep party politics aside for sure, but at the end of the day, there is some level of politics involved here because at present the Asiatic Lions in Gir have given Gujarat a unique status in all of India, if not in the whole world. It is understandable that they’re at reluctant to give up that status. However, this isn’t the best for conservation of the species, and also while they will lose their solo status, it doesn’t mean that they will lose all wildlife tourism value altogether. I mean there are several habitats of the tiger, sloth bear, leopard, elephant and rhinoceroses in India, and yet some locations do get more visitors because of various reasons:\n1) Abundant population\n2) Terrain amenable for safari/sightings\n3) Facilities provided by the forest department and/or the state government.\n\nAs to the recent announcement by the PM, it may not result in anything unless the Gujarat state government comes to the table.\n\nSo, the question remains - why is the rest of the country, or more precisely the Union government allowing the state of Gujarat to effectively hold the lion population hostage?",

Is it completely closed? or are there any places we can still visit but only jungle safari is not allowed?\n\nAlso I read somewhere that Rann of kutch is best visited in November since they have some festival and the water from monsoon rain would have evaporated to form roads and stuff. Initially, I considered skipping Rann of Kutch entirely but many say it is a cool place\n\nDoes Punjab have similar closed-off corridors in September?",

Don’t unless you already have a solid job backing—here’s why.”. **For many from the Indian subcontinent, coming to Germany without a confirmed job (or even worse, banking on “post-MS opportunities”) is a high-risk gamble. Here’s why:**\n\n**1. The German economy is slipping, not surging**\n\n* Germany’s real GDP declined by about **0.2 % in 2024**, following declines in 2023. ([Economy and Finance](https://economy-finance.ec.europa.eu/economic-surveillance-eu-economies/germany/economic-forecast-germany_en?utm_source=chatgpt.com))\n* Growth projections for 2025 and 2026 remain weak: structural headwinds, external demand pressure, and internal inefficiencies weigh heavily. ([Economy and Finance](https://economy-finance.ec.europa.eu/economic-surveillance-eu-economies/germany/economic-forecast-germany_en?utm_source=chatgpt.com))\n* Germany has entered what many economists call a prolonged stagnation or crisis era. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_economic_crisis_%282022%E2%80%93present%29?utm_source=chatgpt.com))\n* In industrial sectors, especially automotive, machinery, and manufacturing, order books are thinning, competition from global markets is fierce, and margins are under pressure. ([Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-25/germany-s-industry-crisis-deepens-as-bosch-cuts-13-000-workers?utm_source=chatgpt.com))\n* A survey found that **one in three German companies plans job cuts in 2025**. ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/one-three-german-companies-plan-job-cuts-2025-iw-survey-finds-2025-04-17/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))\n\nThis is not a booming economy welcoming newcomers — it’s a shrinking space where companies are tightening, not expanding.\n\n**2. Defence spending surge won’t translate into broad hiring**\n\n* In recent years, Germany has committed to a dramatic increase in defence expenditure, including a plan to spend **\\~€650 billion over five years**, effectively doubling its military investments. ([Atlantic Council](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/germany-wants-to-double-its-defense-spending-where-should-the-money-go/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))\n* Constitutional law changes now allow defence spending above 1 % of GDP to bypass the “debt brake” (i.e. fiscal limits) via a special fund. ([Sachverständigenrat für Wirtschaft](https://www.sachverstaendigenrat-wirtschaft.de/en/spring-report-2025.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com))\n* But the problem: much of this procurement is capital‐intensive, oriented toward large defence contractors, high‐end technology, and imports. Local job spillover is limited. ([Atlantic Council](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/in-depth-research-reports/issue-brief/waiting-for-the-big-bang-executing-the-european-defense-build-up-in-germany/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))\n* One analysis suggests that for 1 % extra public spending, the employment boost is only \\~0.1 to 0.15 % (i.e. tens of thousands) — modest relative to the scale needed. ([Recruitonomics](https://recruitonomics.com/can-increased-defense-spending-save-the-german-economy/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))\n* So even with defence spending as a growth lever, the translation to mass jobs is weak and concentrated — not a safety net for broad job seekers.\n\nIn short, defence is being used more as a political shield than as a broad economic lifeline for newcomers.\n\n**3. Social security, welfare, and safety nets are under strain**\n\n* The German welfare state (healthcare, pensions, unemployment support) is facing deep stress: ageing population, declining workforce, and rising dependency ratios. ([Le Monde.fr](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/economy/article/2025/09/12/in-germany-social-welfare-is-no-longer-sustainable_6745324_19.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com))\n* Social spending consumes **\\~31 % of GDP**, and deficits in pension systems, health, and care are ballooning. ([Le Monde.fr](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/economy/article/2025/09/12/in-germany-social-welfare-is-no-longer-sustainable_6745324_19.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com))\n* German Chancellor has publicly acknowledged that the current welfare system is “no longer economically sustainable.” ([Le Monde.fr](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/economy/article/2025/09/12/in-germany-social-welfare-is-no-longer-sustainable_6745324_19.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com))\n* Reforms (raising retirement age, cutting benefits) are being debated fiercely, but reforms take years, and for newcomers, the waiting period can be brutal. ([Le Monde.fr](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/economy/article/2025/09/12/in-germany-social-welfare-is-no-longer-sustainable_6745324_19.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com))\n* Meanwhile, many eligible people *don’t even claim benefits* (the “non-take-up” phenomenon) because of bureaucratic complexity or stigma. ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21535?utm_source=chatgpt.com))\n\nThis means the safety net you imagine is eroding. You may find yourself with few fallback options if a job disappears.\n\n**4. The “blocked account” trap and its implications**\n\n* To get a student visa (for MS or similar), non-EU students must open a **blocked account (Sperrkonto)** and deposit a fixed sum that they can only withdraw monthly. ([CBS University](https://www.cbs.de/en/blog/opening-german-blocked-account?utm_source=chatgpt.com))\n* The required amount was raised: from \\~€11,208/year earlier to **€11,904/year** (i.e. \\~€992/month) from Sept 2024. ([Fintiba](https://fintiba.com/blog/blocked-amount-increase-to-992-euro/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))\n* If the visa appointment is delayed or blocked account funding fails, your whole visa may be rejected. ([Expatrio](https://www.expatrio.com/about-germany/challenges-securing-german-student-visa?utm_source=chatgpt.com))\n* Some students have reported issues: blocked account providers stopping payments, accounts being declared unlawful, or delays in monthly transfers. ([Studying in Germany](https://www.studying-in-germany.org/intl-students-in-germany-struggling-financially-after-blocked-account-provider-stops-monthly-payments/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))\n* Because you can withdraw only the fixed monthly sum, you have zero liquidity buffer for emergencies, relocation, or joblessness.\n* If your visa gets cancelled or you’re forced to return, unlocking or recovering that blocked sum can become bureaucratic and slow.\n\nIn effect, you are financially tethered before you even set foot in Germany.\n\n# 5. Social Media Influencers: Misleading Aspirants\n\nMany social media influencers are misleading potential migrants and students from the Indian subcontinent by painting an overly rosy picture of life and opportunities in Germany. These influencers, often motivated by views, sponsorships, or agent commissions, routinely downplay the severe economic risks, the tightening job market, and the bureaucratic challenges discussed above. Instead of providing accurate information, they promote unrealistic expectations, encourage risky moves without proper preparation, and gloss over the increasing number of jobless international graduates struggling to stay afloat in the current climate. Trusting such influencers puts many at risk of financial loss, emotional stress, and disillusionment when the reality of Germany’s job market becomes clear.\n\n# 6. Major Layoff Events (July 2024 – present)\n\nBelow is a **numbered list** of verified, large layoffs or reduction programs among major German / Germany-based firms. Each is backed by credible news reporting.\n\n**1** Bosch **plans to cut 13,000 jobs (mostly in the automotive division in Germany) by 2030. (**[**Le Monde.fr**](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/economy/article/2025/09/26/bosch-to-cut-13-000-jobs-in-blow-to-germany-s-auto-industry_6745749_19.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)**)|Le Monde / Reuters via Bosch announcement (**[**Le Monde.fr**](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/economy/article/2025/09/26/bosch-to-cut-13-000-jobs-in-blow-to-germany-s-auto-industry_6745749_19.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)**)**\n\n**2** Siemens (Digital Industries unit)**|Cut 5,600 jobs, about 2,600 in Germany. (**[**Reuters**](https://www.reuters.com/technology/siemens-cut-5600-jobs-automation-business-2025-03-18/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)**) Reuters / Siemens reporting (**[**Reuters**](https://www.reuters.com/technology/siemens-cut-5600-jobs-automation-business-2025-03-18/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)**)| |3|**DHL (Post & Parcel Germany division)**|Cut 8,000 jobs in Germany as part of cost savings over a multi-year plan.

(**[**Reuters**](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/sustainable-finance-reporting/commerzbank-agrees-job-cut-terms-with-works-council-2025-05-14/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)**)|Reuters (**[**Reuters**](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/sustainable-finance-reporting/commerzbank-agrees-job-cut-terms-with-works-council-2025-05-14/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)**)**\n\n**5** Audi (Volkswagen Group)**|Will cut 7,500 jobs in administrative & R&D by 2029 in Germany. (**[**Reuters**](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/volkswagens-audi-cut-7500-jobs-administration-development-by-2029-2025-03-17/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)**) Reuters (**[**Reuters**](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/volkswagens-audi-cut-7500-jobs-administration-development-by-2029-2025-03-17/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)**)**\n\n**6** Porsche (subsidiary in Germany)**|Plans additional 1,900 job reductions by 2029 beyond earlier cuts. (**[**Reuters**](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/porsche-aims-cut-around-1900-jobs-by-2029-reports-dpa-2025-02-13/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)**) Reuters (**[**Reuters**](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/porsche-aims-cut-around-1900-jobs-by-2029-reports-dpa-2025-02-13/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)**)** \n\n**7** ZF Friedrichshafen (powertrain) Plans to cut **7,600 jobs** (around 25% of its powertrain workforce) by 2030. ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/auto-supplier-zf-group-cut-7600-jobs-powertrain-unit-by-2030-2025-10-01/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) Reuters ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/auto-supplier-zf-group-cut-7600-jobs-powertrain-unit-by-2030-2025-10-01/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))\n\n⚠️ Many of these are multi-year reduction programmes rather than immediate mass layoffs — but they signal that these companies see shrinking demand and structural reset, not growth. Also, additional firms in Germany (e.g. in chemicals, manufacturing) have quietly scaled back smaller operations.\n\nGiven this environment, expecting a large influx of overseas-trained graduates or job-seekers to be absorbed is unrealistic.\n\n# Summary & Message to Job/Student Seekers from the Indian Subcontinent\n\n* Germany’s economy is **not booming** — it is stagnating or contracting in many sectors.\n* The defence spending push is **not going to create mass jobs** for international newcomers.\n* Germany’s social welfare net is **under duress and reforming downward** — the fallback you imagine may not exist.\n* The blocked account requirement traps substantial capital and leaves you financially immobile if things go wrong.\n* Major German corporations are actively cutting roles; demand for fresh entrants is dwindling.\n\n**Bottom line**: Unless you already hold a firm job offer in Germany, migrating as a job seeker is a precarious move. And as a student relying on “post-MS jobs,” you may find yourself locked into debt, restricted by visa rules, and shut out of real opportunities.",

      "content": "India's Defence Minister warns Pakistan of their aggressive approach towards the Sir Creek region. **Context**: Sir Creek is a vital 96-kilometre marshy estuary situated between Gujarat (India) and Sindh (Pakistan), flowing into the Arabian Sea. The core of the dispute lies in determining the boundary: India advocates for a mid-channel demarcation based on the thalweg principle, while Pakistan maintains that the boundary should be positioned along the eastern bank. Although this area is uninhabited, it carries significant implications for maritime boundaries, fishing rights, and access to valuable oil and gas reserves. Despite numerous discussions, the issue remains unresolved and periodically intensifies due to underlying strategic tensions.

They claim up to \\~50 % cost reductions in rocket production.    \n•Their existing launch vehicle under development is Agnibaan, a modular small-satellite launcher.    \n•As a stepping stone, Agnikul already flew a suborbital demonstrator called Agnibaan SOrTeD (Sounding/Rapid Test Demonstrator), which successfully flew in May 2024 to \\~20 km altitude, thereby validating their engine, control, and trajectory systems.    \n•The first full orbital version of Agnibaan is still under development, and the reusability enhancements would come in future variants.  \n  \n[https://www.manufacturingtodayindia.com/agnikul-cosmos-reveals-plans](https://www.manufacturingtodayindia.com/agnikul-cosmos-reveals-plans)",

I still think India is wasting resources with a misguided focus on aircraft carriers for mere ego-driven posturing and showmanship.\n\nAircraft carrier is a mobile airfield - a concept spearheaded by powers like USA, UK, and even Japan, which sought to project air power to distant theatres far from home shores. India's primary focus should be on fighting wars in its own local vicinity against neighboring adversaries. There's no scope for bombing Venezuela, nor could India hope to send an aircraft carrier to fight in the South China Sea without seeing it sunk.\n\nThe only platforms that could be sent farther out towards Chinese waters and be even remotely survivable would be stealth platforms like submarines and stealth bombers. Those are mainly what US would be counting on sending against China, since they know surface ships could easily be sunk.\n\nWe should realistically not be looking to fight beyond Malacca Straits - at least not without strong support from other local navies. US clearly doesn't care about undercutting our ability to stand up to China, as seen by Washington's close support to Pakistan.\n\nIn fact, Washington seems to be inching towards G2 accommodation with China. I don't know where that will leave their traditional allies - Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Philippines, Australia, etc - up the creek without a paddle, I guess.",

      "content": "Evil Has No Gender: Indore to Host First-Ever ‘Surpanakha Dahan’ This Dussehra. This Dussehra, Indore will witness a controversial twist to the traditional Ravan Dahan. Alongside the effigy of the demon king, a giant 11-headed effigy of Surpanakha, Ravan’s sister, will be paraded and burnt at the Mahalaxmi Nagar Mela Ground on Friday evening. The event, called *Surpanakha Dahan*, is being organized by **Paurush**, a group advocating for men who have faced abuse from wives.\n\nEach of the effigy’s 11 heads will carry the faces of women accused or convicted in recent cases of killing their husbands, lovers, or children. At the centre will be Indore’s **Sonam Raghuvanshi**, charge-sheeted along with her lover for the May 2025 honeymoon murder of her husband in Meghalaya. Others featured include **Harsha Padiyar** (Indore), **Hansa Patel** (Dewas), **Muskan Rastogi** and **Ravita Kashyap** (Meerut), **Shashi Devi** (Firozabad), **Nikita Singhania** (Jaunpur/Bengaluru), **Sushmita Dev** (Delhi), and **Gudiya Devi** (Mumbai).\n\nTwo cases of child killings are also represented - **Suchna Seth**, accused of murdering her son in Goa, and **Priyanka Savita**, convicted of killing her three children in UP.\n\nPosters and banners have already been displayed across Indore. Organizers say the theme reflects that “evil, whether male or female, must be destroyed.”\n\n---\n\n| Source: [**www.newindianexpress**](https://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2025/Sep/18/indore-group-to-burn-11-headed-surpanakha-effigy-with-faces-of-accused-women-on-dussehra) |\n|---|\n\n---\n\n**Reflection: It’s a bold and provocative move.**\n\nThe organizers are clearly trying to flip a cultural symbol, saying evil isn’t just male (Ravan), but can also be female (Surpanakha). That challenges a deep rooted bias in festivals, ***where male villains dominate & female perpetrators rarely get symbolized as embodiments of “evil.”*** For men’s rights groups, it’s a dramatic way of drawing attention to male victimization, which often goes unnoticed.\n\nThis event seems designed to spark debate more than anything else. It forces society to confront uncomfortable questions:\n\n> * Why do we rarely acknowledge women as perpetrators?\n> * Should symbolism of “evil” evolve to reflect contemporary realities?\n> * And can activism stay impactful without crossing into spectacle or stigma?",

I was flying back to Bangalore a few days ago and helped a guy at the airport who was struggling with baggage weight and what he could carry. Coincidentally, he ended up being my seatmate on the flight, and even lived near me in HSR. We chatted and decided to take the airport bus together after landing.\n\nI had placed my black Safari bag under the seat in the center luggage section — and dozed off while listening to music. One song later, I opened my eyes and casually glanced over…\n\nMy bag was gone.\n\nInstead, there was a completely different bag — bigger, shinier, with a green stripe. Definitely not mine.\n\nI checked around the bus, asked others, and even looked at the remaining bags. Nothing. I called Akasa Air, and their response was:\n\n“Please send us an email and wait 24–48 hours. Or file a complaint at the airport — the process takes 2–4 days.”\n\nThat didn’t sit well with me, especially with work starting Monday and all my stuff in that bag.\n\nSo I looked at the tag on the wrong bag — it had the person’s name and PNR number. I used the PNR to check their booking on the airline site, downloaded the e-ticket, and found the phone number.\n\nI called him.\n\nHe realized immediately he’d taken my bag by mistake and apologized. He had gone to Nagawara but had a house in Koramangala, which helped. We agreed he’d come by the next day to return it, and he did — around 3:45 PM.\n\nHis friend saw both bags and even said, “How did you mess this up?”\nAnd just then, I got an email from Akasa saying the process could take 3–5 days to even start.\n\nSo yeah — if I had waited, I probably wouldn’t have had my bag in time.\nBecause I acted quickly, I had it back within 13 hours, and I knew who had it within 20 minutes of realizing it was missing.\n\nNo hero moment here — just a reminder that sometimes being calm and doing the obvious thing is more effective than waiting on a system.\n\nHas anyone else gone through something like this?",

I didnt know that there would come a day when I would actually find something.\n\nI wasnt snooping I was j searching something on his safari browser and something happened and his old tabs opened up.\n\nAerocity Escorts was one of them. I started questioning my dad a bit bout when his flight was where did he spend the afternoon. I also thought that who would want sex in the afternoon during a layover if he is actually a cheater. But then I just started mentioning the flight thing to my mum (not the browser thing) and she said how she felt as if he had come a day earlier and stayed in delhi.\n\nI recalled I had called my dad that day and while we were on call I tried to switch it to vid and he would j not pick up eventhough he said he was sleeping when he did pickup he was in his banyan and sleeping and I didnt doubt much cause thats how he sleeps if its too hot but when he was about to cut the call I saw a phone screen in the call I dismissed it thinking it was the reflection of lighting on the marble floor. But as soon as my mum said that I knew I had to tell her. \n\nAnd so I did.\n\nHer response to that was I can never believe that. She said I could've said anything else and she would've believed me but this she doesnt. She said my thinking was dirty and pessimistic. And I left it at that.\n\nI do not know how I feel about this and honestly I wish I wouldn't have told my mother cause what can she do expect tell herself to not believe it. I want her to not bring it up w dad I told her I am with her in this that I too feel dad would not be like such and that I felt responsible to tell her after I saw her reaction eventhough I dont believe it.\n\nIt's just as someone who has been sexually harassed by a family relative before my faith in men is non existent and dad was that safe space for me, the only man I trusted. Not anymore.\n\nI feel extremely narcissistic to think about this rn but all I can see is that how broken it would be to not be loved and adored by someone and I do not want that for myself. So I am spiralling for no fucking reason that in the times I live I am bound to not be loved.",

      "content": "my first tiger siting. This is my story of watching my first ever TIGER in wildlife safari. It's one of those days in january,cloudy atmosphere,cold breeze and a news from people who came before us, \"TIGER nahi hai iss area me\" with disheartened heart i asked my family to atleast be happy that as a family we came for safari and we should be happy even if we see deers and gours. Having this thought in mind we enter Tadoba's gate. after spending 5 mins in the jungle,i saw shouts of frightened group of men running towards us,they stopped us and told us that there is a huge tiger that attacked us from behind. \n\nPanicked us, and my mum got really scared. The guide asked who did he attack,and one from the group said he took one of our cow. and showed us the direction where the tiger attacked his cow. We rushed to the site,while heading towards the site my hand started sweating,my mouth went dry and I couldnt feel my legs. Upon reaching the site we saw something that made the gypsy the quitest,even the gypsy was scared of the site. We saw a huge tiger(chota matka) eating a cow, around 100 meters from us, his face was covered in blood and his canines were flashing white. as we reached there,Tiger took a pause and looked at us with lazy eyes and calculating the threat we were to him. No one in our gypsy was making any movement,everyone was just scared and threatened at the same time. After watching him eat  for 5 mins,he grabbed the cow from upper neck area and started to pull his prey into the forest. imagine a 3-400kg cow being dragged by a tiger,the view is still fresh in my mind. Even after the tiger went into the forest and after 10 mins passed by,no one had the guts to speak in the fear that tiger might hear our voice and come back to charge us(naive us). From getting a news of no tiger siting,than to watch the tiger in one of his furious gesture,i felt lucky for the first time in my life.Gist of this post is,if you feel stuck in life or you are down and out, go and watch a tiger,you will feel alive and refreshed.",

      "content": "Men at work!!!. In the depths of a Sunday morning, the weary travelers returned from the mystical lands of Tirupati, their energy reserves as depleted as a water hole in the dry savannas. Behold, three noble roommates, not succumbing to the temptation of extended slumber, but rising from their beds at the uncivilized hour of 10.\n\nAs the sun cast its gentle rays upon their humble abode, a culinary symphony unfolded. I, the South Indian savant, conjured breakfast puddus with the finesse of a seasoned magician, while my esteemed comrade, a maestro of North Indian delicacies, embarked on a culinary journey with the sacred Rajma. Meanwhile, the third musketeer, undeterred by fatigue, engaged in the ancient art of broom-wielding and mop mastery, transforming the dwelling into a sanctuary of cleanliness.\n\nIn the heart of this domestic safari, exhaustion lingered in the air like the distant call of a tired wildebeest. Yet, not a murmur of complaint escaped their lips. Three valiant lads from Mumbai, each wielding their expertise like seasoned hunters, seamlessly navigating the wild terrain of household chores.\n\nAnd lo, as the breakfast feasting concluded, I, the South Indian maestro, assumed the sacred duty of dishwashing, while the lunch saga unfolded in the hands of the North Indian virtuoso. A triumphant spectacle, a testament to camaraderie and shared responsibilities, as three tired souls conquered the domestic wilderness, emerging victorious in the tale of the Sunday household escapade.",

      "content": "Ayyappan's Legacy: A Tale of Joy and Resilience in a Kerala Village. In the verdant heart of Kerala, nestled among whispering coconut palms, there lived a joyful soul named Ayyappan, a humble coconut seller whose very presence seemed to weave happiness into the fabric of his village. His quaint hut, a larger abode that doubled as a grocery store by the time he turned 38, was more than just a dwelling. It was a bustling hub where villagers not only came to buy their daily essentials but also to exchange stories, laughter, and the warmth of community life.\n\nAyyappan's home was a canvas of colors and traditions, with two beautifully crafted steps leading up to a platform, each adorned with intricate chalk rangoli patterns that sparked the curiosity of every passerby, young and old. It was here, in this small yet welcoming hut, that Ayyappan lived with his short, traditional wife, their spirited daughter, and a mischievous nephew, filling his days with joy and simple pleasures.\n\nEach morning, as the village awoke to the calls of distant roosters, Ayyappan and his family gathered around a banana leaf, their fingers deftly enjoying the steaming dosas, their taste enhanced by the tart, refreshing sip of kokam drink. This was a life of modest means yet rich with contentment.\n\nBeyond his duties as a grocer, Ayyappan also served as the village's unofficial guide. His reputation once brought a senior government officer from Tamil Nadu to his doorstep, clad in a pristine white safari suit, arriving in a gleaming ambassador car—an unusual sight in this quiet part of the world. Together, they ventured through the village and down to a park that cascaded towards a breathtaking sea view. Sitting on a stone bench, sipping coconut water, they talked beneath the watchful gaze of stone-carved statues of Lord Buddha and Shivaji, set against the backdrop of the sea.\n\nThe village fairground was a place of celebration, where Ayyappan’s nephew’s birthday transformed into a festival of joy. The air was alive with the sound of native tunes, the warmth of a bonfire, and the laughter of children playing around a Ferris wheel with pink sofas and numerous swings, sparking a childlike wonder in all who watched.\n\nTragedy, however, wove its threads through the tapestry of Ayyappan’s life. In his forties, as he aimed to ensure a prosperous future for his daughter, he faced the profound sorrow of losing his wife. Yet, in the face of loss, his spirit remained unbroken. He adopted a young boy, his oily hair and old wooden slate a symbol of new beginnings, as he supported his education at a quaint primary school led by an old teacher with thick spectacles.\n\nAs he approached his late forties, Ayyappan’s dreams grew; he yearned for higher education and to develop exceptional talents, reflecting a late-blooming but fierce desire to achieve more. But life had other plans, and at the tender age of 49, he succumbed to tuberculosis, leaving behind a village dimmed by his departure.\n\nYet, Ayyappan’s legacy endured. His life, marked by the simple joys of community, resilience in the face of hardship, and the unending pursuit of happiness, continued to inspire and ignite curiosity in the hearts of those he left behind. In Kerala, his story remained a tender reminder of a life beautifully lived, his spirit a beacon of hope and joy that continued to guide his village.",

      "content": "Weird little incident at an event.. I(22M) visited one education fair at a big hotel where delegates and officials from the USA came to interact with students. I went with my parents and we were seated in a seminar hall and my mom was thirsty. I saw a lot of bottles on a table and I saw a guy wearing a safari suit standing by the table. I casually asked the guy if I could take 2 bottles(I could also see a few foreign delegates sitting there so I also had a doubt if the water and other condiments were only for the staff and delegates)\n\nThe guy(Indian, Mid-Late 20s) replied in an extremely rude tone and asked me why I was asking questions. My head spun for a second as I couldn't understand why someone would be so rude for such a casual thing. I was like, \"Excuse me sir, I just wanted to ask if prospective students and visitors are allowed to take the water bottle\". He was really rude this time and told me that I shouldn't be asking any questions or talk to him. I saw his badge, he was a police man so I figured out he was part of the delegates' security assigned by the state government. I was still shook as why would someone talk to a random person like that so I turned around and started to walk towards my seat. As soon as I turned, a delegate(American, Black woman, early to mid 40s) asked me to take the water and the guy in the safari suit was like \"Who do you think I am? How can you ask questions to me? I'm not the hotel management staff.\" I apologised to him but in my head I was like even he's not the hotel management staff it's not a big deal to answer a simple question or just saying don't know, is not a big deal even if you're the prime minister of India. There are some basic manners and courtesy as a civil, human society.\n\nI came back to my seat and I was thinking how such a small thing can hurt a person's ego. I felt really worthless when the guy talked to me in that way. At the same time I think there are some protocols these people have to follow like not interact with random people when they are at work. Idk maybe I should've been smarter about it.\n\nIdk, what do you guys make of this little incident?",

Hey everyone,\n\nI recently switched from Android to iOS, and while I like Safari for how natural and fast it feels, I’ve run into a problem. Unlike on Android, Safari automatically plays videos at the highest quality, which makes it really difficult to watch shows without burning through my data. A lot of the sites I used before either don’t work properly on iOS, or if they do, they end up eating way more data than they should.\n\nSo, I’m looking for a site that:\n\t1.\tHas a wide library of TV shows (including older and lesser-known ones).\n\t2.\tLets me manually set the quality (I mostly watch in 240p/360p to save data, so this is the most important part).\n\t3.\tPreferably has fewer pop-ups and ads (not a huge deal, but the less annoying, the better).\n\nIf anyone knows a site that works well on iOS/Safari, I’d really appreciate it. Thanks!",

      "content": "Weekend Getaway from Mumbai & Delhi – My Solo Travel Experience at Jawai (Leopard Safari + Peaceful Stay). Hey fellow travellers! 👋\n\nI recently did a solo weekend trip to Jawai, a lesser-known gem in Rajasthan known for its leopard safaris, serene landscapes, and peaceful village vibes. Posting this for anyone who wants a wild yet soul-soothing escape—especially if you’re looking for something doable from Mumbai or Delhi over a weekend. 🙌\n\n🐆 Why Jawai?\nUnlike the usual jungle safaris, Jawai is raw and rocky—leopards roam freely across granite hills and live in harmony with the local Rabari community. I spotted two leopards on a sunset safari, and it felt completely surreal.\n\nOther highlights:\n\nMigratory birds and crocodiles at Jawai Dam\n\nBeautiful sunrises over boulders\n\nNo crazy tourist rush—just calm and wild nature\n\n🚉 Getting There – Very Solo-Friendly\nOvernight trains from Mumbai and Delhi make it super doable:\n\nFrom Mumbai: Board Ranakpur Express or Suryanagri Express (Friday night), get off at Jawai Bandh or Falna, reach next morning\n\nFrom Delhi: Mandore Express, Ashram Express etc. to Jawai Bandh or Mori Bera\n\nFrom the station, I arranged a cab through the stay—super convenient. Jawai is also accessible by road (~3 hours from Udaipur or Jodhpur).\n\n🏡 Where I Stayed: Jawai Retreat\nHands down, this made the trip memorable.\n\nClean, peaceful rooms (they have budget and luxury options)\n\nGreat food, bonfire vibes, and helpful staff\n\nThey arranged my safaris, village walk, and even chai under a banyan tree 🫶\n\nMet another solo traveler at dinner, so you’re not totally on your own\n\nHighly recommend if you're looking for something local, cozy, and not overly commercial.\n\nInstagram : jawairetreat\n\n🧭 My 2-Day Solo Itinerary\nTime\tActivity\nFri Night\tOvernight train from Mumbai/Delhi\nSat Morning\tPick-up & check-in at Jawai Retreat\nSat Evening\tLeopard Safari & sunset on the hills\nSat Night\tBonfire, Rajasthani dinner\nSun Morning\tOptional safari or village walk\nSun Noon\tCheck-out and return\n\n🎒 Travel Tips\nPack layers (cold mornings)\n\nTake binoculars for birding\n\nDownload offline maps (network is patchy)\n\nTrust the locals—they know the land better than any app\n\nFinal Thoughts\nIf you're someone who wants to travel solo but doesn’t want overwhelming crowds or crazy logistics—Jawai hits the sweet spot. It’s wild but safe, quiet but not boring, and gives you that real Rajasthan vibe without the tourist noise.\n\nLet me know if you want contacts, booking info, or help planning a similar trip! 😊",

She (20F) and I were extremely close — texting every day, sharing everything, supporting each other — but over time I started noticing that I was way more emotionally invested than she was.\n\nI was always the one initiating conversations, checking in, keeping things alive, and getting affected deeply. Meanwhile, she cared, but in a more casual, inconsistent way. That imbalance slowly started messing with my peace of mind.\n\nWe had a face-to-face conversation recently where I told her I couldn’t continue like this. Yesterday she asked me to at least unblock her — so I did. Today she messaged me saying, “You know this will make us happy.”\n\nThis was my reply:\n\n> \"It won’t. Neither you nor me.\nI’m letting you know that I can’t reinstate that bond anymore, so don’t waste your time convincing me. I removed the barriers I created only because you said they hurt you — because I never want to hurt anyone, no matter the reason.\nIf you think I’m doing this wrong, or that I’m faking it or seeking attention, feel free to leave me, block me, or do whatever feels right. And if it truly hurts you, you will move on — people will help you do so. Just… stay happy.\"\n\n\n\nNow that I’ve actually sent it, part of me feels relieved — but another part of me feels guilty and is questioning if I was too harsh or dramatic.\nI genuinely cared for her a lot, but I also know the friendship was no longer good for my mental space.\n\nDid I do the right thing by cutting it off completely? How do I make peace with the guilt that comes after making such a final decision?",

Seems like a solid machine but the capacity has me second-guessing. We're a family of four  do we really need 12 kg or am I just getting carried away?\n\nSince this is a pretty big purchase, I checked the price history on Buyhatke  just to see if I'm walking into a bad deal. And of course, there was a sale that ended yesterday. Perfect timing, right? Now the price is same as during BBD and that price is higher than the last 6 months min price. Should I pay this much on this brand?\n\nHere's where I'm stuck - should I go ahead with this Samsung model, check out local stores for better deals, or look at different brands altogether? I've heard LG and Bosch mentioned a lot too, but honestly not sure what sets them apart.",

Bro, you’re flying 3 hours for a glorified DLF with blasting ac?\n\nThe city was built like yesterday, there’s literally zero real culture or history to experience. Just man-made stuff in the middle of a desert. And let’s not even get into how it was built. Yeah, exploited migrant labour (a huge chunk from India), people forced to work in 50°C heat, passports taken, inhuman hours and wages. This is not hidden info, it’s reported by BBC, Amnesty, Al Jazeera, everywhere. Yet no one talks about it. It’s like all that gets ignored because “Burj Khalifa”.\n\nAlso, it’s cheap ik but you can spend the same or less in Thailand, Vietnam, Sri Lanka and those places have actual beauty, culture, nature, food, and vibes. \n\nSo fr... what is the actual appeal? Why are people going again and again? Is it the luxury flex? Shopping? FOMO? And most importantly why's no one talking about it, the dark making of this city?!",

Affordable and still can reach out! Ideally someone who loves travel stuff, and wouldn’t mind trading city noise for the sound of elephants trumpeting at sunrise.\n\nWould love any suggestions, thanks in advance!",

I see a few seats on the Premium Tatkal page but I’m not able to proceed with the booking as it just keeps failing. I tried for the buffer zones too but the website is just shit.\n1) Does anyone have any local contact to get a booking there? \n2) Is it worth driving 10 hr for just the resort? I saw a few experiences like cycling and clay pot making near the village. Just looking for a serene and calming experience.\n\nAlso, any other suggestions would also be really appreciated for destination. Here the details-\nPlanning on leaving from Hyderabad on 1st May morning and be back by 4th May evening.",

You must have often seen \"Use Dipper At Night\" written on the back of trucks or large vehicles in India. Usually we take it as a suggestion to use the dipper at night. But its real meaning is something else.\n\n\"Use Dipper At Night\" is actually an advertisement of a condom company. This tagline gives us the message that we should use condoms to have safe relations at night. This message is presented in a very subtle way, which we often consider as a general message.\n\nThe interesting thing about this advertisement is that this condom is not of any other company, but is manufactured by Tata Motors. This is a unique and creative way to promote your product, which increases the brand's identity.\n\nSo the next time you see \"Use Dipper At Night\" written, know that it is giving an important message, which tells the importance of safe relations.",

      "content": "The Current State and Future Scope of Autonomous Vehicles in India. Autonomous vehicles (AVs) represent a transformative leap in mobility, promising safer roads, reduced congestion, and efficient transportation. In India, where chaotic traffic, diverse road conditions, and high accident rates are commonplace, AVs could be a game-changer. However, the journey is just beginning. Let’s dive into the current landscape and what lies ahead.\n\n**Current State of AVs in India**\n\nIndia’s AV market is still in its early stages, valued at around USD 2.6 billion in 2024. ￼ While full self-driving cars aren’t commercially available yet, semi-autonomous features like Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS)—including adaptive cruise control, lane-keeping, and automatic emergency braking—are increasingly integrated into vehicles from manufacturers like Tata, Mahindra, and Maruti Suzuki. ￼ Startups are leading the charge: Bhopal-based Swaayatt Robots has demonstrated a modified Mahindra Bolero navigating busy Indian roads, dodging cows, pedestrians, and erratic traffic using AI and sensors. ￼ ￼ Similarly, pilot projects for self-driving taxis are underway in tech hubs like Bengaluru and Hyderabad. ￼\nRegulatory hurdles persist—the Indian Motor Vehicles Act of 1988 doesn’t accommodate AVs, and proposals for amendments have stalled. ￼ Union Minister Nitin Gadkari has voiced strong opposition, stating that driverless cars won’t be allowed to protect the livelihoods of 70-80 lakh drivers. ￼ ￼ Despite this, initiatives like IIT Bombay’s Global R&D Centre for Connected and Autonomous Vehicles are fostering innovation, focusing on India-specific challenges like unstructured roads and adversarial traffic. ￼ As of 2025, AV testing is limited to controlled environments, with companies like Flying Wedge Defence unveiling AI-powered drones and UAVs for related applications. ￼\nIndia’s unique conditions—dense urban chaos, rural potholes, and mixed traffic—make it an ideal testbed for robust AV tech, as noted by startups pushing boundaries in real-world demos. ￼ ￼\n\n**Challenges Ahead**\n\nAdoption faces significant barriers. Infrastructure gaps, such as inconsistent road markings and poor connectivity, hinder AV deployment. ￼ Job displacement is a major concern, with millions in the driving sector at risk. ￼ Ethical issues around data privacy, safety in adversarial scenarios (e.g., wrong-side driving), and consumer trust also loom large. ￼ Skeptics argue that full autonomy might take 10-15 years, given the struggles even in structured markets like the US. ￼ ￼ High costs for sensors and AI hardware further delay mass rollout, especially when human drivers remain cheaper. ￼\n\n**Future Scope: A Promising Horizon**\n\nLooking ahead, India’s AV market is projected to explode, reaching USD 45.8 billion by 2035 with a CAGR of over 26%. ￼ ￼ By 2030, Level 4 autonomy (fully driverless in specific zones like highways or industrial parks) could become reality, integrated with electric vehicles (EVs) for sustainable mobility. ￼ AVs could slash road accidents (India sees over 1.5 lakh fatalities annually), ease congestion in megacities, and boost logistics via robotaxis and autonomous trucks. ￼ ￼\nGovernment incentives like PLI schemes for EVs and AI missions (e.g., IndiaAI) will accelerate growth, alongside global trends where L2/L2+ features dominate new cars by 2030. ￼ ￼ Connected cars with V2X tech are already gaining traction, paving the way for smarter ecosystems. ￼ Startups envision AVs in airports, golf clubs, and urban delivery, with exports to 100 nations on the horizon via models like Maruti’s e-Vitara. ￼ ￼ Lessons from global leaders like Ireland suggest a surge in semi-autonomous features by 2025, evolving into full autonomy. ￼\nIn essence, AVs could revolutionize India’s transport, but success hinges on policy reforms, skill development for displaced workers, and investments in AI and infrastructure. With rapid urbanization, the potential is immense—India might not just catch up but lead in handling complex, real-world autonomy.\n\n\nWhat do you think? Will AVs thrive in India’s traffic mayhem, or are we decades away? Share your thoughts! 🚗🤖",

Another guy bought his parents their dream home. In both reels, everyone is commenting \"Great son\" and \"Proud son,\" but no one is commenting \"spoiled parents.\" Why?\n\nSo my point is, when parents buy something expensive for their kids, everyone calls the kid a spoiled brat. But when the kids buy expensive things for their parents, everyone calls them a proud son or a great son. If people say a \"real son\" buys their own things with their own money, then why can't \"real parents\" buy their own things-like a car, a house, or foreign trips-instead of using their children to fulfill their materialistic desires?\n\nPlease answer your thoughts",

I'm also saving 100% of my internship money to get a bike for myself.\n\nIdk what to do and I can't take this guilt associated with even using my scooter. I can't deal with this bs.

      "content": "Why India Sucks at Sports. It’s easy to blame the government or the media for India’s poor performance in sports, but let’s be honest, the problem starts much closer to home.\n\nMost Indian families don’t take sports seriously. Early mornings? Our streets and sports academies are silent. But by evening, traffic builds up outside fast-food joints, and seven-seater SUVs are packed with families munching on junk for hours.\n\nThink back — how many of us had cousins or friends growing up who were encouraged to be athletes? Barely any. Sports were always treated as a distraction, not a career. And now, in the name of “fitness,” we’ve glamorised shallow gym culture — a place that often feels more like a beauty contest than an arena of strength and discipline. Hitting the gym is trendy; playing a sport is still seen as wasting time.\n\nOur priorities are completely upside down. Say you want a beer after work — that’s fine. Spend ₹10,000 on alcohol for a wedding? Acceptable. But tell your family you want to buy a good pair of cycling tyres for ₹15,000, and it’s suddenly “too much.” Bro, we’re overweight. If we want to run on asphalt with our knees intact, we need quality shoes. And those cost money. But in the age of instant EMIs and easy finance, this sector still doesn’t get the attention, because what drives our economy is FMCG, not fitness.\n\nAnd it’s not just attitude — it’s lifestyle. Go anywhere and you’ll see kids snacking on chips, chaat, and sweets. We glorify our food habits, even though they’re nutritionally terrible. Our parents proudly serve carb on top of carb — rice with potatoes, puri with halwa, bread with sugary tea — and call it culture. It’s not.\n\nWe’re a malnourished country not just because of poverty, but because of our rigid, broken diet patterns. According to the National Family Health Survey, 70% of Indians identify as non-vegetarian, but the average meat consumption is barely 2.5 kg per year per person. That’s not even close to supporting basic protein needs — forget athletic performance.\n\nUntil we shift our mindset, fix our diet, and rethink our priorities, we’ll keep failing in sports. It’s not a government failure. It’s a cultural one.",

      "content": "Tired of People Acting Like Moral Police Online But Doing the Opposite in Real Life. Recently, I saw a classmate of mine (we were good friends once) post something on Reddit about how we should treat domestic workers and sanitation staff with more respect and dignity. Fair enough — it's a valid point. But what annoyed me is that I've personally seen her avoid touching her own trash when handing it over to sanitation workers. She’d act all “above it” and make a face, like it was beneath her.\n\nThis isn't just about her.\n\nJust this morning, I was at a cigarette shop and overheard two people passionately discussing how Modi JI has made Swachh India (this isn’t a political post, just quoting them). Five minutes later, they finished their tea and casually threw their paper cups on the street like it was nothing.\n\nI constantly file complaints and RTI's and try to hold local authorities accountable — broken roads, poor garbage disposal, etc. But what’s the point if the people around me don’t even TRY to be decent citizens?\n\nIt drives me mad to see this performative morality — posting “deep” stuff online, judging others, and acting woke, while in real life, they’re part of the same problem they claim to hate.\n\nSo here’s my question:  \nWhy do people feel the need to act like moral police online but refuse to reflect in real life?  \nAnd more importantly, how do we fix this mindset?\n\nDo you know people like this? Have you ever called them out?\n\nI don’t have a solution yet. But I feel like calling this out even anonymously is a first step.",

I realize that many conditions can develop in the body without obvious symptoms. Because of this, I've decided to arrange a full body checkup for them twice a year, as we haven't done this before.\n\nI need some guidance on this process. Could you please recommend reputable clinics or at home testing services that are reliable and not misleading? \n\nAlso, it would be extremely helpful if you could list all the important tests that should be included in a comprehensive health screening.

How do you normally communicate with other who doesn't know about your condition, like may be while travelling (asking for auto, taxi and bus rides or while travelling in a local and have to book a physical ticket)\n\n2. Have you faced any kind of problem during marriage or getting into relationship, like during arranged marriage has anyone rejected you due to your condition?\n\n3. Did you learned sign language or anyone from you home (like parents) learned sign language?\n\n\nI am sorry if these questions come in any wrong way to you or hurt you in any way, I am just trying to know so I could write my story naturally and don't make it awkward.\n\nPEACE✌️",

      "content": "Unorganised Australian who would love your help with my trip to India next month! Flying into Mumbai, headed to Dharamshala.. Firstly I apologise in advance for any ignorance or queries I could google. I find the internet can be a bit broad when it comes to travel, would much rather attain advice straight from locals! \n\nI'm visiting India for the first time next month with my dad and brother, we absolutely cannot wait. Bit of backround, my brother and I are young adults and my dad is in his early 50s but we're all active and keen for anything. \n\nPlan so far is fly into Mumbai and have a look around there for a couple days. \nWe're then undecided on what to do between there and the 26th, as we're then heading to Dharamshala to watch India v Australia which should be amazing. \n\nWe really wanna get the most out of the period between Mumbai Dharamshala (13 days, 16th-28th of Feb).\n\nWe wanna go South to Kerala. Apparently Kochi has amazing houseboat tours. If theres anywhere else down south we must visit do let us know ! \n\nI've pitched the Idea of heading to Udaipur/Rajasthan, and visiting a national park, potentially an animal friendly safari tour. \n\nWe have 8 nights booked in Dharamshala, giving us 2 days to look around before the cricket on the 1st-5th of March. \n\nWe booked this long as we'll be busy with the cricket for most of our stay there, and don't wanna miss out on exploring the foothils of the Himalayas. However that is quite a long time, so if you think we can get more out of visiting the north and ending up in Dharamshala just before the cricket, then thats definitely a possibility, as my brother isnt such a fan of Cricket and 8 days in Dharamshala is probably a bit much for him.\n\nA couple other queries I had were: \n\n* I'll receive my passport about 13-14 days before our trip on the 15th of Feb (I know, stupid). Visas to India supposedly take 1-14 days. I really dont wanna risk this, apparently It'd only take 1-2 days on Ivisa.com, happy to pay the $30 if theres any truth to that! \n\n*  As far as converting money goes, Is it best we bring AUD cash over, convert it, then load it onto a card? \n*  Absolutely anything you guys thinks could assist us on our trip would be amazing! Things to bring, what to expect etc etc.\n\nThank you so much in advance. I can't wait for our trip. My great great grandad was born in Jaipur and I'm really proud of that heritage.\n\nUpdate : https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/112t71x",

First of all I'd just like to say that I grew up in Kenya (18 years) and I've been to India twice now. Love it. Growing up in Kenya I used to go on safari frequently. Since going to India I haven't been on a safari. We would love to try to see a wild tiger. My biggest question would be what all is involved? Are there any places that are better than others? Is hiking an option? I will say that I am bringing my wife, who has been to India once, and she will be going to Kenya with me this year. Thanks for taking the time to read this and I appreciate any info. \nEdit: Thanks to everyone for responding! This is very helpful information. I really just can't wait to go back.",

Please share your opinions on these and if one of you can spare some time, we can have some polls too. I am just trying to restrict myself to the best among nominees here, but feel free to extend beyond in the discussion.\n\nThe format of the following list is the winner of the year is first and followed by nominees. Copied from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filmfare_Award_for_Best_Actor\n\n \n*     1974 Rishi Kapoor – Bobby as Raj Nath\n*         Amitabh Bachchan – Zanjeer as Insp. Vijay Khanna\n*         Dharmendra – Yaadon Ki Baaraat as Shankar\n*         Rajesh Khanna – Daag: A Poem of Love as Sunil Kohli\n*         Sanjeev Kumar – Koshish as Hari Charan Mathur\n\nThis one was the one which Rishi Kapoor said he had to buy. Obviously he had to, cause this year had Amitabh in Zanjeer and Sanjeev Kumar in Koshish. My pick is Sanjeev Kumar.\n\n*     1975 Rajesh Khanna – Avishkaar as Amar\n*         Dharmendra – Resham Ki Dori as Ajit Singh\n*         Dilip Kumar – Sagina as Sagina\n*         Manoj Kumar – Roti Kapda Aur Makaan as Bharat\n*         Rajesh Khanna – Prem Nagar as Chhotey Kunver Karan U. Singh\n\n\nNo idea\n \n*     1976 Sanjeev Kumar – Aandhi as J.K\n*         Amitabh Bachchan – Deewaar as Vijay Verma\n*         Manoj Kumar – Sanyasi as Ram Rai\n*         Sanjeev Kumar – Sholay as Thakur Baldev Singh\n*         Uttam Kumar – Amanush as Madhusudan Roy Chaudhary\n\nCan't argue with this pick. Uttam Kumar from Amanush is a close second.\n \n*     1977 Sanjeev Kumar – Arjun Pandit as Arjun Pandit\n*         Amitabh Bachchan – Kabhi Kabhie as Amitabh Malhotra\n*         Amol Palekar – Chhoti Si Baat as Arun Pradeep\n*         Dilip Kumar – Bairaag as Kailash / Bholenath\n*         Sanjeev Kumar – Mausam as Dr. Amarnath Gill\n\nCan't argue here too. Amol Palekar is the second pick.\n\n\n*     1978 Amitabh Bachchan – Amar Akbar Anthony as Anthony Gonzalves\n*         Amitabh Bachchan – Adalat as Thakur Dharam Chand / Raju\n*         Sanjeev Kumar – Yehi Hai Zindagi as Anand Narayan\n*         Sanjeev Kumar – Zindagi as Raghu Shukla\n*         Vinod Khanna – Shaque as Vinod Joshi\n\nThis one really depends on your tastes, but Amitabh's performance can be said to be the best in the group. \n \n*     1979 Amitabh Bachchan – Don as Don / Vijay\n*         Amitabh Bachchan – Muqaddar Ka Sikandar as Sikandar\n*         Amitabh Bachchan – Trishul as Vijay Kumar\n*         Sanjeev Kumar – Devata as Tony/Tarun Kumar Gupta\n*         Sanjeev Kumar – Pati Patni Aur Woh as Ranjeet Chhadha\n\nI would have still gone for Amitabh but in Muqaddar ka Sikandar. \n\n*     1980 Amol Palekar – Gol Maal as Ram/Laxman Prasad Dasharath Prasad Sharma\n*         Amitabh Bachchan – Kaala Patthar as Vijay Pal Singh\n*         Amitabh Bachchan – Mr. Natwarlal as Natwarlal\n*         Rajesh Khanna – Amar Deep as Raja / Sonu\n*         Rishi Kapoor – Sargam as Raju\n\nCan't argue with this one\n \n*     1981 Naseeruddin Shah – Aakrosh as Bhaskar Kulkarni\n*         Amitabh Bachchan – Dostana as Vijay Varma\n*         Raj Babbar – Insaaf Ka Tarazu as Ramesh R. Gupta\n*         Rajesh Khanna – Thodisi Bewafaii as Arun Kumar Choudhary\n*         Shatrughan Sinha – Dostana as Ravi Kapoor\n*         Vinod Khanna – Qurbani as Amar\n\nNo arguing with this one too.\n\n*     1982 Naseeruddin Shah – Chakra as Looka\n*         Amitabh Bachchan – Lawaaris as Heera\n*         Amitabh Bachchan – Silsila as Amit Malhotra\n*         Kamal Haasan – Ek Duuje Ke Liye as S. Vasudevan 'Vasu'\n*         Rajesh Khanna – Dard as Deepak Srivastav / Vikas\n\nAmitabh in Silsila/Lawaaris can be considered here. This is one of the few years where an art movie performance was considered above a good mainstream performance.\n\n \n*     1983 Dilip Kumar – Shakti as DCP Ashwini Kumar\n*         Amitabh Bachchan – Bemisal as Dr. Sudhir Roy / Adhir Roy\n*         Amitabh Bachchan - Namak Halaal as Arjun Singh\n*         Amitabh Bachchan - Shakti as Vijay Kumar\n*         Naseeruddin Shah – Bazaar as Salim\n*         Rishi Kapoor – Prem Rog as Devdhar 'Dev'\n*         Sanjeev Kumar – Angoor as Ashok R. Tilak\n\nThis is one of the years where any judge will sweat while thinking of picking only one. Amitabh in Namak Halal/Shakti, Naseeruddin in Bazaar and Sanjeev Kumar in Angoor!!!! Wow, and even Rishi Kapoor gave a career best performance (younger career) in Prem Rog. Pick Any, it is a tough year.\n\n*     1984 Naseeruddin Shah – Masoom as D. K. Malhotra\n*         Kamal Haasan – Sadma as K. Somprakash 'Somu'\n*         Om Puri – Ardh Satya as Sub-inspector Anant Velankar\n*         Rajesh Khanna – Avtaar as Avtaar Krishen\n*         Sunny Deol – Betaab as Sunny Kapoor\n\nAnother tough year. Masoom , Sadma and Ardh Satya!!! I personally would have gone for Sadma.\n\n\n*     1985 Anupam Kher – Saaransh as B. V. Pradhan\n*         Amitabh Bachchan – Sharaabi as Vicky Kapoor\n*         Dilip Kumar – Mashaal as Vinod Kumar\n*         Naseeruddin Shah – Sparsh as Anirudh Parmar\n*         Raj Babbar – Aaj Ki Awaaz as Prof. Prabhat Kumar Varma\n\nNaseeruddin Shah in Sparsh gives a good competition, but I don't think anyone would argue against this one too.\n \n*     1986 Kamal Haasan – Saagar as Raja\n*         Amitabh Bachchan – Mard as Raju Singh\n*         Anil Kapoor – Meri Jung as Arun Verma\n*         Kumar Gaurav – Janam as Rahul\n*         Rishi Kapoor – Tawaif as Dawood Mohammed Ali Khan Yusuf Zahi\n\nKamal Haasan is the best among the nominees. But his year clearly seems a weak year compared to previous ones.\n\n*     1987 No Award\n* \n*     1988 No Award\n*     1989 Anil Kapoor – Tezaab as Mahesh \"Munna\" Deshmukh\n*         Aamir Khan – Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak as Raj\n*         Amitabh Bachchan – Shahenshah as Vijay Kumar Srivastava / Shahenshah\n\nBest among the nominees won this one. \n \n*     1990 Jackie Shroff – Parinda as Kishen\n*         Aamir Khan – Raakh as Amir Hussein\n*         Anil Kapoor – Eeshwar as Ishwarchand Vishnunath Brahmanand\n*         Rishi Kapoor – Chandni as Rohit Gupta\n*         Salman Khan – Maine Pyar Kiya as Prem Choudhary\n\nJackie Shroff is the best pick and this is among his best movies. When did Gardish come? I do not see it in the nominations. It seems that it was snubbed. \n \n*     1991 Sunny Deol – Ghayal as Ajay Mehra\n*         Aamir Khan – Dil as Raja\n*         Amitabh Bachchan – Agneepath as Vijay Deenanath Chauhan\n*         Chiranjeevi – Pratibandh as Siddhanth\n\nAs good as Sunny Paaji was here, I feel Amitabh was snubbed this year.\n\n*     1992 Amitabh Bachchan – Hum as Tiger / Shekhar Malhotra\n*         Aamir Khan – Dil Hai Ke Manta Nahin as Raghu Jetley\n*         Anil Kapoor – Lamhe as Virendra Pratap Singh\n*         Dilip Kumar – Saudagar as Veeru Singh\n*         Sanjay Dutt – Saajan as Aman Verma\n\nOne can argue for other nominees but I feel this one is correctly chosen.\n\n\n*     1993 Anil Kapoor – Beta as Raju\n*         Aamir Khan – Jo Jeeta Wohi Sikandar as Sanjaylal Sharma\n*         Amitabh Bachchan – Khuda Gawah as Baadshah Khan\n\nHard to pick between Anil Kapoor and Amitabh here, but I am fine with either.\n \n*     1994 Shah Rukh Khan – Baazigar as Ajay Sharma/Vicky Malhotra\n*         Aamir Khan – Hum Hain Rahi Pyar Ke as Rahul Malhotra\n*         Govinda – Aankhen as Bunnu / Gulshan / Gaurishankar\n*         Jackie Shroff – Gardish as Shiva P. Sathe\n*         Sanjay Dutt - \"Khalnayak\" as Ballu Balram\n\nWow, Jackie was unlucky to have Gardish in this year. This one is SRK's award. No doubt.\n\n\n*     1995 Nana Patekar - Krantiveer' as Pratap Narayan Tilak\n*         Akshay Kumar - Yeh Dillagi as Vijay Saigal\n*         Aamir Khan – Andaz Apna Apna as Amar Manohar\n*         Anil Kapoor – 1942: A Love Story as Narendra Singh\n*         Shah Rukh Khan – Kabhi Haan Kabhi Naa as Sunil\n\nNo arguing with this one. I also feel if I argue Nana from this movie would argue back and I won't be able to answer back.\n\n*     1996 Shah Rukh Khan – Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge as Raj Malhotra\n*         Aamir Khan – Rangeela as Munna\n*         Ajay Devgan – Naajayaz as Jay Bakshi\n*         Govinda – Coolie No. 1 as Raju\n*         Salman Khan – Karan Arjun as Karan Singh\n\nSRK or Aamir depending on your taste. Rangeela was no doubt one of the best performances by Aamir, but one can argue for SRK in DDLJ too.\n\n*     1997 Aamir Khan – Raja Hindustani as Raja Hindustani\n*         Govinda – Saajan Chale Sasural as Shyamsunder\n*         Nana Patekar – Khamoshi: The Musical as Joseph Braganza\n*         Nana Patekar – Agni Sakshi as Vishwanath\n*         Sunny Deol – Ghatak: Lethal as Kashi Nath\n\nNana Patekar was very clearly snubbed.\n\n*     1998 Shah Rukh Khan – Dil To Pagal Hai as Rahul\n*         Anil Kapoor – Virasat as Shakti Thakur\n*         Govinda – Deewana Mastana as Bunnu\n*         Kamal Haasan – Chachi 420 as Jaiprakash Paswan / Laxmi Godbhole\n*         Sunny Deol – Border as Kuldip Singh Chandpuri\n\nI would have given it to Anil Kapoor this year.\n\n\n*     1999 Shah Rukh Khan – Kuch Kuch Hota Hai as Rahul Khanna\n*         Aamir Khan – Ghulam as Siddharth Marathe\n*         Ajay Devgan – Zakhm as Ajay R. Desai\n*         Govinda – Bade Miyan Chote Miyan as Pyare Mohan / Chotey Miyan\n*         Salman Khan – Pyaar Kiya To Darna Kya as Suraj Khanna\n\nIt is Aamir's award. It seems that the second half of the nineties is the worst time for filmfare. It is at this time that they clearly are favouring box office collections than performances.\n\n \n*     2000 Sanjay Dutt – Vaastav: The Reality as Raghunath Namdev Shivalkar\n*         Aamir Khan – Sarfarosh as Ajay Singh Rathod\n*         Ajay Devgan – Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam as Vanraj\n*         Manoj Bajpai – Shool as Samar Pratap Singh\n*         Salman Khan – Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam as Sameer Rossellini\n\nI won't argue with this one. Sorry, Aamir.\n\n \n*     2001 Hrithik Roshan – Kaho Naa... Pyaar Hai as Rohit / Raj Chopra\n*         Anil Kapoor – Pukar as Major Jaidev Rajvansh\n*         Shah Rukh Khan – Mohabbatein as Raj Aryan Malhotra\n*         Sanjay Dutt - Mission Kashmir as SSP Inayat Khan\n*         Hrithik Roshan - fiza as Amaan Ikramullah\n\nIt seems like a snub, but the other nominees are also not that great. I personally would have given it to SRK.\n \n*     2002 Aamir Khan – Lagaan as Bhuvan\n*         Aamir Khan – Dil Chahta Hai as Akash Malhotra\n*         Amitabh Bachchan – Aks as Manu Verma\n*         Shah Rukh Khan – Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... as Rahul Y. Raichand\n*         Sunny Deol – Gadar: Ek Prem Katha as Tara Singh\n\nNo arguing here\n \n*     2003 Shah Rukh Khan – Devdas as Devdas Mukherjee\n*         Ajay Devgan – Company as Mallik\n*         Amitabh Bachchan – Kaante as Yashvardhan 'Major' Rampal\n*         Bobby Deol – Humraaz as Raj Singhania\n*         Vivek Oberoi – Saathiya as Aditya Sehgal\n\nNo arguing here too.\n\n \n*     2004 Hrithik Roshan – Koi... Mil Gaya as Rohit Mehra\n*         Ajay Devgan – Gangaajal as Amit Kumar\n*         Amitabh Bachchan – Baghban as Raj Malhotra\n*         Salman Khan – Tere Naam as Radhe Mohan\n*         Shah Rukh Khan – Kal Ho Naa Ho as Aman Mathur\n\nOne can argue for other nominees here, but I personally feel that this one is correct.\n \n*     2005 Shah Rukh Khan – Swades as Mohan Bhargav\n*         Amitabh Bachchan - Khakee as DCP Anant Kumar\n*         Hrithik Roshan – Lakshya as Karan Shergill\n*         Shah Rukh Khan – Main Hoon Na as Major Ram Prasad Sharma\n*         Shah Rukh Khan – Veer-Zaara as Veer Pratap Singh\n\nNo arguing here\n\n*     2006 Amitabh Bachchan – Black as Debraj Sahai\n*         Aamir Khan – Mangal Pandey: The Rising as Mangal Pandey\n*         Abhishek Bachchan – Bunty Aur Babli as Rakesh Trivedi / Bunty\n*         Amitabh Bachchan – Sarkar as Subhash Nagre 'Sarkar'\n*         Saif Ali Khan – Parineeta as Shekhar Roy\n\nNo arguing here too\n\n \n*     2007 Hrithik Roshan – Dhoom 2 as Mr. A / Aryan\n*         Aamir Khan – Rang De Basanti as Daljeet 'DJ' / Chandra Shekhar Azad\n*         Hrithik Roshan – Krrish as Krishna 'Krrish' Mehra\n*         Sanjay Dutt – Lage Raho Munna Bhai as Murli Prasad Sharma\n*         Shah Rukh Khan– Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna as Dev Saran\n*         Shah Rukh Khan – Don as Don / Vijay\n\nAamir was snubbed here. Hrithik was the epitome of cool in Dhoom 2, but.... I don't know, we generally do not considered good cool acting as acting. In any case, Aamir created a classic character in RDB which would be long remembered.\n \n*     2008 Shah Rukh Khan – Chak De! India as Coach Kabir Khan\n*         Abhishek Bachchan – Guru as Gurukant Desai\n*         Akshay Kumar – Namastey London as Arjun Singh\n*         Darsheel Safary – Taare Zameen Par as Ishaan Awasthi\n*         Shahid Kapoor – Jab We Met as Aditya Kashyap\n*         Shah Rukh Khan – Om Shanti Om as Om Prakash Makhija / Om Kapoor\n\nNo arguing here\n \n*     2009 Hrithik Roshan – Jodhaa Akbar as Jalaluddin Muhammad Akbar\n*         Aamir Khan – Ghajini as Sanjay Singhania\n*         Abhishek Bachchan – Dostana as Sameer \"Sam\" Kapoor\n*         Akshay Kumar – Singh Is Kinng as Happy Singh\n*         Naseeruddin Shah – A Wednesday! as The Common Man\n*         Shah Rukh Khan – Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi as Surinder 'Suri' Sahni\n\nIt is Naseeruddin's award\n\n \n*     2010 Amitabh Bachchan – Paa as Auro\n*         Aamir Khan – 3 Idiots as Ranchoddas 'Rancho' Shamaldas Chanchad / Phunsukh Wangdu\n*         Ranbir Kapoor – Ajab Prem Ki Ghazab Kahani as Prem Shankar Sharma\n*         Ranbir Kapoor – Wake Up Sid as Siddharth Mehra\n*         Saif Ali Khan – Love Aaj Kal as Jai Vardhan Singh/Young Veer Singh\n*         Shahid Kapoor – Kaminey as Charlie / Guddu\n\nGood nominees but it is Amitabh's award. Next choice is Shahid. Sorry, Aamir.\n \n*     2011 Shah Rukh Khan – My Name Is Khan as Rizwan Khan\n*         Ajay Devgan – Once Upon a Time in Mumbaai as Sultan Mirza\n*         Hrithik Roshan – Guzaarish as Ethan Mascarenhas\n*         Salman Khan – Dabangg as Chulbul Pandey\n*         Ranbir Kapoor – Raajneeti as Samar Pratap Singh\n\nBest among the nominees won.\n\n\n*     2012 Ranbir Kapoor - Rockstar as Janardhan \"Jordan\" Jakhar\n*         Ajay Devgan – Singham as Bajirao Singham\n*         Amitabh Bachchan – Aarakshan as Prabhakar Anand\n*         Hrithik Roshan – Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara as Arjun Narula\n*         Salman Khan – Bodyguard as Lovely Singh\n*         Shah Rukh Khan – Don 2 as Don\n\nAgain, no arguing with this one.\n\n \n*     2013 Ranbir Kapoor – Barfi! as Murphy \"Barfi\" Johnson\n*         Hrithik Roshan – Agneepath as Vijay Deenanath Chauhan\n*         Irrfan Khan - Paan Singh Tomar as Paan Singh Tomar\n*         Manoj Bajpai – Gangs of Wasseypur as Sardar Khan\n*         Salman Khan – Dabangg 2 as Chulbul Pandey\n*         Shah Rukh Khan – Jab Tak Hai Jaan as Major Samar Anand\n\nIrrfan was snubbed. Second choice is Manoj Bajpai. \n\n \n*     2014 Farhan Akhtar – Bhaag Milkha Bhaag as Milkha Singh\n*         Dhanush – Raanjhanaa as Kundan Shankar\n*         Hrithik Roshan – Krrish 3 as Rohit Mehra/Krishna Mehra\n*         Ranbir Kapoor – Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani as Kabir \"Bunny\" Thapar\n*         Ranveer Singh – Goliyon Ki Raasleela Ram-Leela as Ram Rajari\n*         Shah Rukh Khan – Chennai Express as Rahul Mithaiwala\n\nOne can argue for Dhanush here or even Ranveer Singh. But, I think this is a correct winner.\n\n*     2015 Shahid Kapoor – Haider as Haider Meer\n*         Aamir Khan - PK as PK\n*         Akshay Kumar – Holiday: A Soldier Is Never Off Duty as Virat Bakshi\n*         Hrithik Roshan – Bang Bang! as Jai Nanda/ Rajveer\n*         Randeep Hooda – Rang Rasiya as Raja Ravi Varma\n\nNo arguing here.\n\n\n*     2016 Ranveer Singh – Bajirao Mastani as Bajirao I\n*         Amitabh Bachchan – Piku as Bhashkor Banerjee\n*         Ranbir Kapoor – Tamasha as Ved Vardhan Sahni\n*         Salman Khan – Bajrangi Bhaijaan as Pavan Kumar Chaturvedi 'Bajrangi'\n*         Shah Rukh Khan – Dilwale as Raj Randhir Bakshi/ Kaali\n*         Varun Dhawan – Badlapur as Raghav ' Raghu' Pratap Singh\n\nBest among the nominees won.\n \n\n\nOverall it seems to me that more often than not (I would say about 70-80% times), the best among the nominees wins. Also, there was a phase during late 90s, early 2000s that had a few obvious snubs. In the past decade also, there are only 3 times one can argue there was an obvious snub.\n\nIn any case, what are your opinions?",

      "content": "Why is the Indian suitcase industry so broken?. Yes this is a rant. I'm mad. \nSo my family owns a few VIP and Safari suitcases and bags, some of which we got as gifts and others we bought. Almost every one of them has given us some sort of trouble within warranty. Got a 4-wheeler VIP suitcase when they were recently launched and two of the wheels broke within two uses. Recently got a bag and one of the wheels went kaput within 6 months. \n\nThe worst part? Their websites are disgusting. Nowhere you can find anything about getting your bags fixed or repaired, within warranty or otherwise. And this is where I started getting frustrated. I wrote an e-mail to Safari in the 'contact us' page requesting a location where I can take it in for repair and there's no reply yet. VIP does it even worse, their 'contact us' page is a feedback page. \n\nOut of curiosity, I went over to American Tourister's (owned by Samsonite)  'warranty and service' page and it handed me a PDF with their locations, their contacts and addresses. \n\n\nNow I own nothing that's made by American Tourister or Samsonite so I'm not promoting either of these brands but why don't indian brands give better support for their products? It's like they just want to sell and bail. There's no responsibility. It's almost like once you've bought something from them, you're on your own. I remember that my parents struggled to get their VIP suitcases fixed even within warranty in the past and had to run around store to store; each of which directed them to go to another store for warranty claims, that too in Delhi (this was in the early 2000s so no internet for us). \n\nWhat's a customer supposed to do with these things once they break? Even in warranty they're a pain to get fixed.\n\nUpdate: called the number given for their Pune centre and both numbers are registered as service numbers but also invalid. Wow.\n\nUpdate 2: went to a VIP showroom and that problem will be sorted soon. Safari is still dodgy. Never buying from either of them again tho.",

      "content": "\"African Safari!!\" - Open Racism in a Bangalore Kannada Daily. The furore that was generated by the racial harassment of the Tanzanian student in Bangalore, many of my fellow Kannadigas were quick to say that Karnataka isn't like that.\n\n\"African Safari\" screams today's headline in a popular Kannada daily edition of Today. The newspaper goes to length to cast aspersions & innuendos about the African community here in Bangalore. \n\nWhile it is easy to criticize English newspapers & media for all their omissions & commissions, at least they have been sensible, pragmatic & mature. But the vernacular press gets away with open racism, casteism & regionalism. This is the newsmedia the auto drivers, labourers etc get to read & it generally clouds their mindset and makes discrimination acceptable. And these are the same people who beat, strip & harass people who are 'different'.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/pptBFht\n\nEdit: The headline says 'African Savaari' not 'African Safari'. But the point still stands. The paper calls the Tanzanian ambassador's entourage as an African Savaari (African Ride)",

      "content": "The Scam that is JioFiber. **Disclaimer:**\n\nThis post is coming after a lot of frustration being built up. I don't expect everyone to find this appropriate to bring out here or express my anger. But I needed to vent it out and let people know of the inconvenience caused to me by Reliance Jio. All the names of people mentioned have been changed from the real name.\n\n**Prologue:**\n\nWe have had JioFiber from sometime now. I have renewed it for 6 months in March of this year. Unfortunately it has not worked as promised ever since. I have had registered approximately 2 complaints with customer care every week since subscription, that makes a total of at least 8 complaint since March 2021 when my plan has begun. Every-time a technician/engineer has come they fiddle for a few minutes and then go away until the problem arises again. \n\nHowever, this time it got too serious to take it lightly… or to listen to their excuses.\n\nThe problem began on 23rd April 2021 when I was uploading a 50gb to my OneDrive on my wifi (JioFiber). I have a 300 mbps plan from them Here are what they have promised to me from what I remember: \n\n1: A download speed of 300 mbps \n\n2: An upload speed of 300 mbps, \n\n3: A free phone connection, that is a landline number. \n\n4: A Jio SetTop box with about 15 OTT services as promised by them. (Don't remember all of them by heart)\n\nBefore we go ahead, for anybody that doesn't know. In any given internet connection, for example mine. The actual download speed is calculated by dividing 300 mbps by 8. So, 37.5mbps is how many data packets should be transmitted. \n\nIf you use Google Chrome, this is the rate of transfer the Download Manager should be showing. However, since wifi has some loss so anybody should be prepared to see a number not exactly the same but slightly lower. **Slightly** being the operative word.\n\n**Part One:**\n\nComing back to uploading the file I noticed the file itself was uploading only at a speed of 10-20 mbps. Which if I reverse, and multiply by a factor of 8 goes to 160 Mbps, half the plan promised to me.\n\nI registered a complaint for the same on 23rd April, 2021. Next day, 24th April, 2021 an engineer Mr. Ram visits my premises. After spending an hour looking at what I explained to him (Screenshots attached). He was unable to find a solution and called his superior Mr. Shyam. Who also was unable to fix this issue and asked me to wait for the Networking team to get back to me. This was as mentioned on Saturday, 24th April, 2021. By the end of 26th April there was no response so I followed up with Mr. Shyam.\n\nMore on that in a bit…\n\nI have a 300 mpbs plan as mentioned above and if I visit any ‘Speed test’ website, like Ookla, or [fast.com](http://fast.com/) or the Jio recommended NetVelocity. The same is reflected perfectly. That means they all show that my devices are getting a speed of 280 mbps, which according to the earlier mentioned **slightly** lower speed is accurate. \n\nUnfortunately, it feels like manipulating as the **real world** test does not even come close to any of the numbers provided. I am getting download speed in Kbps and maximum of 10-12mbps when using Safari or Chrome browser, to download large files from wither OneDrive or Google Drive. Where the same at one point was reflecting 30-31 mbps.\n\nI am attaching the screenshot from my browser for anybody reading this to look at. One is of a speed test website which shows great internet speeds. Unfortunately when I opened Chrome browser to use Google Drive and One Drive individually right after that test. Either of them when downloading a file are unable to get the download speed from speed test.\n\nI am aware that if speed test shows 284.88 Mbps, I should be getting a reflecting speed of 284.88/8 = 35.61Mbps in my browser. However, the numbers are no where close to that. It’s sad to the point where even WhatsApp text messages take 2-3 seconds for a single tick mark (delivered status) to show.  \n \n\n**Part two:**\n\nAfter following up on 27th and 28th April, 2021 with the supervisor Mr. Shyam mentioned above. \n\nAnother engineer Mr. Rohan had visited my premises on 28/04/21 Wednesday. I demonstrated the issue once again to him and he could not provide a solution. He then connected me with his superior, Mr. Tanmay. He said he understood my issue and explained to me that to further escalate the issue Mr. Rohan would need to bring the company laptop to my premises and test the same issue. \n\nCurrently we had tested it on my phone, my fathers phone, my laptop with 2 web browsers and 2 separate websites. But more testing is always better so I agreed. \n\nThe engineer, Mr. Rohan did indeed visit my premises next day 29/04/21 Thursday, along with a colleague. \n\nHe then proceeded to do speed test on his laptop and phone over wifi on the websites mentioned above, OOkla, [Fast.com](http://fast.com/), and net velocity. To my surprise the speeds did not match on even one of the websites/devices. On the laptop OOkla showed a speed of 150 mbps. [Fast.com](http://fast.com/) showed 400 mbps. And OOKla on his phone showed 220 mbps.\n\nHet then tried downloading some files on his laptop and phone from different websites one of which was Disney+ Hotstar on his phone. Now the file from Hotstar app was downloading on his phone, and it did not show the download speed, but the percentage. So we tried to time it. Taking 220 mbps as an accurate speed.\n\n220 mbps / 8 = 27.5 mbps. The file was 2.98 gb. So, by calculation 2980 mb / 27.5 mbps = 108.36363636 seconds. That means 1.8 minutes the full file should be downloaded. I rounded it off to 2 minutes. So hoping 2 minutes the full 100% of the file should have been downloaded. \n\nNow for the interesting part, in the entire 2 minutes over wifi where all my other device had been disconnected, because even though they’re are not being used background data will take up speed. In the entire 2 minutes only 10% got completed.\n\nThe same was tried to replicate over LAN on his laptop. This time [Fast.com](http://fast.com/) showed a speed of 600 mbps. And this time we could see the download speed in the Download manager of the browser. 10 mbps. Which translates to 80 mbps.\n\nRunning multiple tests on LAN and Wifi on 2 of his devices there was **no resolution**. Even having spoken to his superior Mr. Tanmay and explained the same to him did not bring me any resolution. Mind you Mr. Tanmay was being sent videos and photos of everything from Mr. Rohans phone. So he was being updated every minute of the issue.\n\nAll in all there was testing done on, 2 cloud storage drives each on 2 different browsers on my laptop. My phone. My fathers phone. 2 engineers phones. And the company laptop as recommended by Mr. Rohan.\n\n  \n**Jio Conclusion**\n\nEven after all this extensive testing and pleading Jio multiple times I was told finally told 2 things.\n\n1: We are the internet provider, its not our responsibility to take care of the download speeds you receive at your end.\n\n2: There must be some issue with the websites I am visiting and they must be blocking the internet.\n\nAfter this I was tired. Since I could not keep asking Jio engineers to keep coming over because of COVID restrictions, and also having my parents and grandfather in the house. I just asked the person to leave.\n\n  \n**My Conclusion**\n\nI don’t understand how they cannot take accountability and responsibility for the low internet speed proved in front of their eyes. \n\nIf it was the websites problems then why ask me to wait for tests to be done on the company laptop. And how can all the websites across all the devices ( mine and the engineer’s) have the same issue, but nothing is faulty on the Jio side.\n\nIf anybody is considering to shift to Jio or thinking to stay long term, please consider this post as a real review of the service. Just wanted to put this out with everyone so that if there are similar people facing same issues they can also put it here.  \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Google Drive](https://preview.redd.it/bcevi3m5maw61.png?width=1520&format=png&auto=webp&s=eb803a3a0c8df809ca84f77bfec84babe615fe7c)\n\n[One Drive](https://preview.redd.it/1w7326m5maw61.png?width=1520&format=png&auto=webp&s=4571cf7e1667ff1796af64bb362f891b77c99459)\n\n[Speed test OOkla](https://preview.redd.it/75ctb7m5maw61.png?width=1520&format=png&auto=webp&s=8932c764627958dc9f295ce8939bb66b84c2d902)",

      "content": "MRW I see the \"India has beautiful roads too!\" circlejerk (And Rant too). New reddit user and long time lurker here!\n\nI saw all these posts and noticed that in most of them, the views were beautiful but the roads were shit. They should be titled, \"India has beautiful views too!\" But that shows the sheer potential of our nation as a tourist and sightseeing location. Just like how they have Safari Tours to Africa, we can have to too with the Ghats and other places!\n\nVery few countries have the beauty where you can go skiing in the Himalayas one moment, smoke weed in the forests another, bask in the desert after that, trek through the jungle, and finally chill at the beach with a refreshing beer! And during the whole time, you can see history in your eyes as you visit monuments!\n\nAnd that could be only possible if we had decent infra. I know that it takes around 4 hours to get from Pune to Mumbai. A distance of only 150 km. And that is considered \"State of the Art!\" In other countries including China and even some African nations, I see that same distance covered in an hour or so! It's pathetic how we consider this state of the art!\n\nImagine if we had roads and a traffic structure that allowed foreigners to do the trip that I described above very quickly!\n\nAnd as a Civil Engineer specialized in roads and working in Japan, I cringe every time I see roads back in the motherland. They look okay from the outside but misses some key features to make them worthwhile. I notice the poor grading done which creates some disgusting and uneven ridges in them. And cost isn't a problem here. It is the fucked up, \"Chalta hain\" attitude. It costs the same to grade a road properly. I see footpaths that require you to go full hanuman to get over them! A very bad design flaw which makes it difficult for people with disabilities! In addition, I also see some extremely high up dividers in city roads. That is also a big flaw in the design as emergency vehicles which are sometimes designed to go over shallow medians cannot anymore. I don't know why the median is there in the first place. Perhaps it has to do with chutiya drivers in India who would be driving in the wrong direction if it wasn't there. But even Japan has physical dividers.\n\nAnd I looked at the road code put by the congi gobernment, and it was an exact copy of the British system. They didn't even put effort into changing the terminology! You see, the problem here is that we Civil Engineers of India look like idiots who cannot do anything right! We lose all pride. And on top of that, does it hurt to have an indigenous system that we can pride in? Imagine if ISRO was just a copy of Russian Design!\n\nAnd even we can contribute to road design. We have many bright minds in our country who are lost effort. When I was in Uni, all we did was memorize the British road code and had to regurgitate them out on our exams and do some calculations! What if we get the Uni students to design the code with professors as research? Not only would it look good on resumes, but we would end up with a fantastic road code of our own and it will get the innovative spirit when it comes to building infra!\n\nAnd we have ISRO which we take great pride in. I always wanted to suggest getting ISRO and the Cabinet Committee On Infrastructure to create a state of the art software that maps the country as well as the roads with GPS accuracy! And this can be a sort of AutoCAD software that Civil Engineering students can practice road design virtually and even design the new road code and test it on that software! And that same mapping and finalized design can be used to build the roads with a proper code and everything!\n\nAnd the problem about infra is that all these key flaws will be a pain in the ass 50 years down the line. Lets say India is one of the top superpowers then and we realize this later. It will cost a trillion dollars in correcting this shit!\n\nDoes anybody know how I can suggest this idea to the government?",

      "content": "A Journey to Chikmagalur which proved me that humanity still exists in the people !.   It was a joyful ride from Bangalore to Chikmagalur .We have reached our destination by night and planned for safari in the morning and visit some water falls later .But God has some other plans for us . As our plan we started early in the morning and started to Bhadra wild life sanctuary .To our disappointment we could not see a single tiger in the whole safari . \n        We started our return journey from there .It was a ghat road  and we took a few snaps on the way .The climate was cool and started drizzling. We are all enjoying the drive but all of a sudden the car went out of control and moved towards the valley and went down till some distance  . I had to say we are very lucky as there was a strong tree to stop the further movement of the car . If not for that , I wouldn't be here writing this post . As soon as one of my friend got out , he called for help and people started to gather around and asking questions if are safe and all .I couldn't come out as the door was struck .Later some one helped me  and I came out side .Two of us remained at the site and we asked the rest of our friends to leave for the hotel. \n    We are stuck there in the rain with our car which cannot be taken out with out a crane looking for help. and there comes a stranger how stared helping us and sent a police to us. The police and very polite and first asked f we are safe and called for a crane and went on his way . It was still raining heavily and  we should wait there for one hour for crane to come . Another stranger passed by on bike smiling at us .We thought he is having fun looking at us in this situation ,but to our surprise he came with an umbrella .\n   we some how returned with the car to the hotel and needed some repair to the car (only the front was damaged and it is full condition).  The search for mechanic was very difficult as it was a Sunday afternoon and all the garages were closed .In this search we have encountered  some four people who are very patient to direct where we can find a mechanic. And when we finally found one he was very helpful and kind that he came all the way fixed our car tested it and assured we can go back driving it .  \n   There are some more people who helped us  all the way back to Bangalore. After this incident I have learned that we should never loose faith in Humanity .",

      "content": "Help me plan my travel itinerary.... to Rajasthan and more!. Hi good people of r/ india ... so I wish to do some solo travelling before I leave for Canada for my studies. I plan to do this for about 25 days after Diwali and I hope that staying in hostels … and travelling and other things... it'll come under 40k …\n\nPlaces that I wish to visit:\n\nI'll take a train(the 3AC) from Delhi to ...\n\nRajasthan: It has so much variety and colours and is different from the North where I'm from and also from Canada haha… so I'd like to experience it and please tell me how much time should I spend in each place.\n\nJodhpur, Jaisalmer, Udaipur(Chittorgarh, Kumbhalgarh, Ranakpur), Pushkar ( it has that camel festival from 4th November)… I don't think there's much in Jaipur!.... maybe a day in Ranthambore National Park too since I have never been in a safari before.\n\nAfter this I'm confused about where to go...I think I could either go from Udaipur to Mumbai( 16 hrs).... then Goa( 13 hrs)... then Hampi( 8 hrs)… (I feel like this is a really interesting place unlike any other, so this deserves a visit) …staying few days in each place but then I'm unsure which way to come back and also if so many places are even possible... should I return the same way and the take a final flight from Mumbai(5k) if I go this way?\n\nOr I could go east to Khajuraho temple from Udaipur( 22 hr train journey)… then to Varanasi( 13 hrs)… But I think this is a bit astray from the typical route and I'm not sure if I should go to Varanasi but it also attracts me because it would be the most Indian place .\n\nNow places I have already visited which I'm leaving are Taj Mahal and Golden Temple and Agra... and the cold places of north... Also, I have a tour planned to Andaman Islands next month with my family... so maybe I could spend less time in Goa if you guys advise me go through that route.\n\nP.S. I'll be 19 by the end of this trip and this is going to be my first trip ever which I'll document on my camera too. Besides, I( a dude) figured that if solo women from the west could manage to stay safe in India... I can pull this through too ! Any advice you all give would be appreciated. Thanks!",

The cheapest RWD car available right now is the BMW 3 series, the cheapest one is 26 lakh rupees.\n\n\nWHY? :(",

We think the country has a lot to offer and want to start our journey with Rajasthan by honeymooning there. \n\nRelating to this, I had a few questions. Would be grateful if someone could give me some clarity.\n\n- Is November a good time to visit? \n- What is an ideal no. of days? \n- Which desert safari would you recommend?\n- Any **must** visit places?\n\nI've heard a bunch about camping in the desert under the stars and am very excited about it. Any info about this would be awesome as well :)\n\nThanks y'all!",

      "content": "What is the most common performance/enthusiast-type car in your area?. After Doug Demuro posted his highly entertaining birthday car safari video last week, I decided on my way to and from work I'd pay extra attention to the kinds of vehicles I see driving around.   It looked like it'd be a lot of fun.  And the results so far have been....disappointing.   While I have seen the occasional interesting vehicle, (The LC500H I saw was stunning; way more striking car in person than in pictures), the vast majority I see are the pony/muscle car triplets, which is no surprise considering I live in the Southeast.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut what really shocked me is the particular distribution of those three I have observed.  For every Mustang or Camaro I come across, I see five or six Challengers.   In fact, the number of Challengers I see is kind of absurd, when you consider their relative sales numbers and what I *should* be seeing based on them.    There should be way more Mustangs statistically, but it seems to be the less popular model in my area.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nToday, on the way home, on a 18 mile trip, I saw **seven Challengers**.  This is not an unusual number.  I haven't had a day where I've seen less than four of them on my commute, either way.  Of the seven today, almost all of them were straight up base V6's, with a single Scat Pack mixed in.  None of the more exotic ones were present.  Two had tacky vinyl hood wraps and side decals.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo what's the most common \"performance\" or \"enthusiast\" or just plain...not-milquetoast-commuter car in your area?  I'm kind of curious how this might differ in other places, and if maybe I just live in some kind of Challenger-purgatory.",

For those who don't know Cadillac debuted a new subscription ownership model today. $1500 per month, and you have your choice of any fully loaded Cadillac. You can switch between models anytime, up to 18 times per year. Escalade for the road trip, then right back to your cts-v platinum for your commute. All maintenance, and insurance is included in the $1500. \n\nNo long term obligation, and no worries about lease returns over mileage etc. When you are done just turn in the car. \n\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/www.theverge.com/platform/amp/2017/1/5/14177698/cadillac-book-car-subscription-service-1500-a-month?client=safari\n\nI think this may be a stroke of genius. I am certainly not in the demographic of people with $1500 per month to spend on my choice of any fully loaded Cadillac. However I think this could really translate well to other segments of the car market. This would be especially true if a company could do this across multiple brands. \n\nImagine if their was a service for say $5-600 that had a bunch of fun cars to choose from in the $30,000 range like Gtis, Tacoma's, camaros etc. Or scale it to a higher price like $7-800 for mid level luxury cars. \n\nI would be all over that to sample a bunch of different cars without the stress of dealing with a dealership Everytime, and never worrying about maintenance again. \nThe company could just do as the rental car companies do, and blow out the cars after 20,000 miles for pretty good money. \n\nI would gladly pay a few extra $$$ per month to have the flexibility of just changing cars on a whim.",

About a year and a half ago my fuel pump went out while driving down the highway. Since then I have had an issue with the truck stalling. At first it was pretty severe with stalling out almost every time I came to a complete stop or put the truck in reverse. Ended up changing the oil pan gasket on a suggestion. Truck stalls less often now. So far i have replaced the fuel pump, fuel lines, fuel filter, alternator, drive belt, idle pulley, belt tensioner, battery, spark plugs, and air filter. The truck will still occasionally stall out about once every 3-400 miles when coming to a stop. Any advice for this issue on where to proceed would be appreciated.",

There was no warning sign that the power steering was going and no funny noises before it failed (ive had it fail on previous vehicles).

Hi there\n\n\nMy catalytic converter was stolen in 2022 and an auto shop replaced it. 6 months later when I had to get an emissions test done, they failed me for faulty converter which they then replaced under warranty. This was after they told me they couldn’t find my records and I had to go in person to show them the receipt. After that they were able to find it. They replace it under warranty but will charged me for labor. Fast forward till today when I am due for another emissions test. They fail me again on a faulty converter.\n\n\n1. At this point I have reason to believe their parts are faulty. Should converters be failing every two years?\n2.

      "content": "Blower Motor Issue - 2017 Toyota Corolla SE. I've had issues with my A/C all summer in my car. Initially, the blower was just having a hard time- but still getting the job done. Eventually I noticed that the A/C wouldn't blow at all on start if I didn't crack my windows during the day, It would kick on eventually- but in it's own time. Eventually I noticed that if I hit a bump or applied some blunt force trauma myself (like slapping the dashboard) my A/C would immediately kick on and work at least until the next time I encountered the issue. But without BFT, I'd have to wait anywhere from 5-40 minutes for the A/C to work.\n\nEventually, my A/C wouldn't kick on even if I cracked the windows AND beat the shit out of my dash (and would not throughout my 45 minute commute.) My grandpa advised me to start with checking the fuse for the blower motor. Which DID look blown (to my eyes- I'm no mechanic and I don't work with electronics regularly at all.) So I replaced the fuse (40a) yesterday during my lunch and everything worked great for the rest of the day (it was cloudy, so unsure if functional A/C was due to fuse or cooler weather.) It's worth noting that the fuse I purchased was probably a half inch taller than the one I replaced. It seated fine and doesn't appear to have unseated, but it is weird that it's so much taller (at least to me.) It was the only 40a fuse Advance Auto Parts had. \n\nToday when I got in my car to head home the blower did not kick on on start- but did kick on when I hit the dash- much lighter than normal too. The motor is much more consistent from a power perspective, but still had issues on start. I want to fix this before I start to depend on the defroster and since I'm going to need an inspection anyways this month- I'd like to have this figured out prior to getting an inspection just in case I need them to also work on the AC system as a whole.\n\nAny suggestions for what might be going on here? I'm thinking that the connection between the motor and the car might be funky- is that something I can diagnose myself? Should I just take it in? Happy for any and all constructive recommendations. Appreciate y'all!",

Experiences? \n\n P.s. I have one free year before doing this choice, any idea on how I could prepare myself?",

      "content": "Car needs more repairs despite running normally. Hi all,\n\nI figured I’d turn to Reddit since I have no idea how to navigate a situation like this. My car is a 2004 Toyota Corolla LE with about ~177,000 miles on it.\n\nI got into an accident Aug 25th of this year. I was NOT at fault and was told at fault party’s insurance would cover any repairs related to accident. I dropped my car off on Sept 2nd (was running as normal, starter was good and battery was normal, no warning lights of any kind). \n\nOne or two weeks into the repairs the main service technician overseeing the process called me and informed me that I needed a new battery since the car wouldn’t start and it was at low voltage. I said that they could replace my battery and whatnot. He did say I would need to pay out of pocket for which I was a bit confused about but said to move the process along.\n\nNow almost a month into repairs (Sept 19th) I was informed that it was NOT my battery and it was my starter was the issue. They claimed even with the new battery the car wouldn’t start so they determined it was the starter. They emphasized the importance of getting it replaced ASAP because it wouldn’t be drivable if I opted out. I felt pressured and just said since I’m not too familiar with cars so I couldn’t really question the process. He also said this would be an out of pocket cost.\n\nI’m not trying to assume the worst or anything like that but is this normal? It’s just super convenient that these things stopped working the moment they aren’t in my possession anymore. \n\nI understand that my car is older, prior to the accident the vehicle was maintained, started, and ran reliably. That’s why I was a bit surprised to hear that the battery suddenly showed low voltage, and even more concerned when I learned that the starter also now needs replacement. \n\nHow do I go about addressing this with the mechanic shop or do I reach out to the third party’s insurance since they are covering these costs?? I’d prefer to resolve this directly with the shop in an amicable way rather than involving multiple parties, but I do need clarity and transparency. \n\nIf anyone has any advice or has suggestions I would gladly take them!!!",

      "content": "So, where do you guys stand on how a can should be positioned while recharging an ac system?. I ask because research on Google, reddit, etc, says to keep the can sitting upright. On the other hand, almost all videos I've watched of the process being done show people either turning the can sideways, shaking the can, or both. It's said that it's supposed to be introduced to the system as gas/vapor, but when I sat the can upright, it seemed like nothing was going on. Does it take longer for the refrigerant to transfer through the lines in gas form or something? To be honest, I lost patience and started turning the cans and shaking a little bit. Turns out I have a new leak from one of my service valves, high side. Just replaced it and am about to give it another try. Pulling a vacuum for about an hour first. \n\nInitially, after recharging yesterday, or maybe yesterday, the compressor kicked on, and the vents blew cold for about 15 minutes, then went back warm. I thought it might be either because I tilted the refrigerant can, I overcharged it, or because of adding too much oil. The manufacturer instructions weren't too clear on the pre-filled amount thatcamem in the new compressor. The amount Amazon said it came with didn't help. Then I poured it out to measur,  and less than an ounce came out. Either way, people here on reddit assured me it's not likely the oil\n\nFast forward to when I thought I might have overcharged it. After it blew cold for 15 minutes and stopped, I happened to discover the high side ball valve service port had a pierce in the middle rubber part and I heard it hissing when I removed the high manifold gauge hose from it. I replaced it today and would appreciate some advice on how the can should be positioned while recharging. \n\nSo, sitting upright the whole time, no matter what? Laying on its side? Tilting back and forth? Upside down? A mixture of two or more of the four? Hope I get it right and over with. I'll be proud, but I am sick of how long it's taking due to all the little issues I ran into. Either way, I think I did pretty well 😌 \n\nThis is on a 2007 Saturn Ion-2 2.2 \n\nR134a refrigerant \n\nThanks for any tips!",

When I first got this vehicle it ran amazing aside from having to replace an alternator and do some bottom end work that was just general maintenance that had been ignored (ball joints, control arms, brakes, rotars ect.). I got it at around 292.000kms and have had it for around 4-5 months and it is now at 319,000 (I drive A LOT of highway and gravel for work). \n\nA few weeks back it started to kind of “bubble” while it idled for about 20 seconds when I first started it and was unable to gain speed going up steep hills and kind of thudded like I was hitting bumps if I tried to step on it going up said hills. \nWe changed the spark plugs because when we looked one was rather “melted” upon checking. \nAfter this fix it ran great for a couple weeks but again I put a fair amount of kilometres on it during these weeks. It sat for the weekend and now it’s doing a much more aggressive “bubbling” when I idle when I first start it and for almost a minute before it idles down and stops and is “bumping” when I accelerate even a little too hard off of a stop sign or when speeding up super quick on the highway, otherwise it drives and sounds as normal as it ever has. A check engine light just came on today. \nWhat could this possibly be? The only thing I did different before it sat for the weekend is put premium gas in (which I almost never do) and some sea foam because I knew I had been driving lots and wanted to do something “nice” for my motor, but I’ve since heard that the gas could potentially be making the problem seem more serious because it’s too “rich”. I don’t know, I’m a girl who has been told a multitude of things that it could possibly be and I just listen because vehicles are not my strong point. I went through 5 cars last year because of the amount I drive for my job and my lack of knowledge when buying used cars. If an issue comes up I usually panic and sell the vehicle before I even try to get it fixed because I don’t understand anything to do with how to even start diagnosing a vehicle. I just am in a spot right now and can’t afford to do a massive fix or flip this car before it blows. \nSo if anyone has some knowledge and can provide any answer that you think it could be, let me know. Even just so I don’t sound like a dummy going in to the mechanic. \nI appreciate any advice:)",

      "content": "Ed Napleton Honda in Oak Lawn #honda. My recent experience at Ed Napleton Honda in Oak Lawn was disappointing. Although it started well with our sales representative, Jose Sanchez, who was patient and communicative, the situation quickly declined.\n\nThe finance phase with Monica was frustrating. Her repeated warnings about the lengthy process lacked the professionalism and empathy expected for a significant purchase like a $40K+ vehicle. She often ignored me, adding to the frustration of spending nearly six hours at the dealership.\n\nThe unavailability of the leasing agent or general manager forced me to return another day, an inconvenience that should have been avoided. Despite assurances that Jose would handle the proof of payoff for my trade-in, I have been repeatedly contacted to provide it myself. This has become disruptive, with numerous calls and texts interrupting my workday.\n\nThese issues overshadowed my initial intention to return and purchase another vehicle. While Jose's service was commendable, the problems with Monica and the subsequent hassle have left me questioning the dealership's ability to provide a consistent and satisfactory experience.\n\nI am deeply frustrated by the lack of communication and the unprofessional handling of my concerns. The excessive follow-ups have been intrusive, making an already stressful process even more burdensome. This has not only deterred me from returning but also compelled me to share my experience widely and escalate the matter to Honda corporate. I expected a seamless transaction and encountered a series of avoidable obstacles that significantly impacted my trust in this dealership.\n\nI've contacted both sales managers and have not received a call or email back. When a salesperson wants to make a sale, everyone is more than willing to go above and beyond to ensure a sale is made. Once the purchase is completed, all lack of effort, professionalism, and follow-up go out the window.",

      "content": "BMW x7 2024 The worst thing you can ever spend your money on. . This is from someone who owned this car for a little less than a year. Bought it cause it looked good compact enough look for a 3 row suv, it’s a BMW, and all raving reviews. \n\nLittle did I know that the internet has become a big heaping pile of marketing crap and no one is honest about anything anymore. Here is my warning for anyone looking maybe it’ll save them: \n\n1. The AC if you live in a hotter than normal area, the AC is severely underpowered and BMW knows enough about that that they decided to give you the very complicated option to pre-condition the car on a timer of when you think you’ll be back. It’s like my dad old car that we had to go in and wait 5 minutes for the engine to heat up before he drove… G I wish we had all this tech to pre-start the car before we got to it. \n\n2. The seats going up and down to get passengers in the 3 row is beyond laughably slow. \n\n3. The infotainment or whatever they call it these days, seriously I have never ever seen anything that stupidly designed in my life. I’m an IT professional that developed UX for many products and this is the dumbest thing I have seen. Who ever designed it didn’t know the meaning of the word intuitive. \n\n4. Yay you have an app for the car, you want your ID to get the proper seating adjustment? You have two options PIN code which you are like wow yeah let me make sure everyone in the car can see me enter the pin code that’s secure, or an app tethered to your ID which never works. \n\n5. The app and the car always thinks you are coming to it, and thinking it’s so smart that it switches your Bluetooth from your phone to your car and unlock your car when you are in a room near the car. \n\nAll in all; I have never wrote a negative review before in my life but this… this is beyond deplorable, BMW should be ashamed of themselves and recall the car replace the AC and completely rebuild the infotainment system.",

      "content": "Help Me Decide: Tata Safari vs. Tata Harrier—Which One Should I Pick?\n. So, I’ve narrowed down my car search to two solid contenders: **Tata Harrier** and **Tata Safari**. Safety is my top priority, so I’m not considering any other options (XUV700 AX5 is out because of the 4-airbag setup). But now, I’m stuck in a dilemma, and I need some advice!\n\n# My Situation:\n\n* **Current Family Size**: 4 members (unmarried)\n* **Future Plan**: Might go up to 5 members after marriage\n* **Driving Needs**: Max \\~500 km/month, city driving\n* **Budget**: Harrier (₹22.5L on-road) vs. Safari (₹23L on-road)\n* **Preferences**:\n   * I like the **Harrier’s looks and feel** better.\n   * Safari doesn’t appeal to me visually (is that just me, or do others feel the same?).\n\n# What’s Holding Me Back?\n\n* The **Safari deal**: For just ₹50,000 more, I get a **7-seater** instead of a 5-seater. Even though I don’t need a 7-seater *right now*, it feels like a better value-for-money option for occasional group trips or emergencies.\n* **Boot Space**:\n   * Harrier already has good boot space for a 5-seater.\n   * Safari could offer similar practicality by folding down the rear seats when the 7-seater isn’t needed.\n\n# Concerns:\n\n1. **Looks**: I find the Harrier more appealing than the Safari. Does anyone else agree, or am I overthinking?\n2. **Utility**: None of my friends own a 7-seater, so having one could make me “that guy” everyone calls for group outings. Still, how often would I really need that extra seating?\n3. **Same Engine**: Both cars share the same engine, mileage, pickup, and comfort, so there’s no mechanical advantage to choosing one over the other.\n\n# TL;DR:\n\nAm I being irrational for leaning towards the Harrier just because of its looks, even though the Safari offers more versatility for just ₹50,000 extra? Or is the Harrier the better choice given my preferences and current needs?\n\nI’d love to hear your thoughts!",

      "content": "[Advice] Help Me Pick My Next Car (7–10 Year Ownership). Hey everyone,\n\nI don’t think I’ve ever been this confused about a purchase in my life. I desperately need help making up my mind, and I know this subreddit will give me the honest takes I need.\n\n**THIS IS A REALLY LONG POST BUT THIS IS HOW CONFUSED I AM**\n\n# Background\n\nI had a Zeta Baleno MT from 2016 and sold it in 2019 due to financial problems and I regret it to this day. Now I am in a much better state and am looking to buy a car which I plan on keeping for atleast another 7-10 years. Driving has always been one of my purest joys, and I don’t think I’ve ever been happier than when I was behind the wheel of that car. My wife has seen how happy I am when we rent a car out and has been forcing me to decide for the longest time. I’ve been at this hunt for over 3 months now pouring in endless hours of research, test drives, YouTube reviews, and dealership visits and every time I think I’m close, some new update or variant launch pulls me back into this spiral again. I’m truly exhausted, but I also know this is not just about buying a car, to me, it’s the most important purchase of my life, more than even a house, because this is where my happiness is.\n\n# Budget & Financing\n\n* Down payment: **₹5–10L** (depending on car)\n* EMI: **Max ₹35k/month** (plan to close loan in 2 years)\n* I want something practical and reliable, but also something that makes me look forward to driving every day.\n\n# Shortlist (in order of preference)\n\n**Citroen Basalt** \\-\n\nThis car stole my heart. I test-drove the pre-BasaltX version, and even without all the features, I fell in love with it. The drive, the feel, the coupe-like design—ever since I saw the BMW X4 years ago, I’ve dreamt of a shape like this, and the Basalt nails it at a realistic price. With the BasaltX launch, it feels like the perfect fit. My heart is completely set on it, but my mind keeps worrying about Citroën’s future in India. It’s not a brand with a guaranteed 7–10 year presence here, and I keep wondering—what if they pull out? Would I regret this every single day after? To add to that, in all these weeks I’ve only seen two Basalts on Mumbai roads, both just recently. I don't know if its a sign and if so, is it to steer clear or to go for it.\n\n**Tata Safari/Harrier -**\n\nThese two black beauties have always been my crushes. Been in love with both since the time of launch and honestly, if budget allowed, I would have blindly gone for the top variant, but budget and the fear of the \"Tata Quality\" is what is keeping me hesitant\n\n**Honda Elevate -**\n\nWe used to own Honda City (Dolphin) and the boxy look of the car is something that pulled me towards it. Like I said, I have put the choices in order of my choice or likeness.\n\n**Nissan Magnite / Renault Kiger (Top Variant) -**\n\nThese tick a lot of boxes—feature-packed, priced attractively, easy on the wallet. But again, that same fear of long-term brand survival in India keeps me worried. Will they still be around a decade from now?\n\n**Tata Nexon (Top Variant) -**\n\n* Objectively makes the most sense (value, safety, features).\n* But my gut just doesn’t want it—it feels like the “default” answer, not something special.\n\n# Cars I’ve Ruled Out\n\n* Skoda Kushaq/Kodiaq & VW Taigun → Maintenance too expensive\n* Hyundai/Kia → Safety concerns\n* Maruti → Build quality not confidence-inspiring\n\n# My Non-Negotiables\n\n1. Automatic (done with manuals in Mumbai traffic). Still can’t figure out what’s best: TC vs CVT vs AMT vs DSG.\n2. Mileage is critical → I do \\~80–90 km daily (city + highway). Leaning toward diesel\n3. Must-haves: ventilated seats, 360° camera, TPMS.\n4. High ground clearance (Mumbai potholes rule out sedans—even though my heart still aches for a Civic).\n5. Infotainment with wireless CarPlay/Android Auto + good speakers.\n6. Cruise control (ADAS not required, not practical in India anyway).\n7. Solid build quality.\n\n**Additional Preferences**\n\n* Tactile buttons for AC, volume, etc. Hate full-touch systems.\n* No interest in second-hand (Mumbai floods + overpriced market = risky).\n* Would actually prefer no sunroof, but higher variants bundle it anyway.\n\n**Where I’m Stuck**\n\n* Heart says Basalt.\n* Head debates Safari/Harrier vs Elevate.\n* Wallet suggests Magnite/Kiger.\n* Logic drags me to Nexon.\n\nI don’t want to make the same mistake I did when I sold my Baleno. This car is going to be my companion for the next decade, through traffic jams, long drives, and everything in between. I just want to get this right.\n\n# TL;DR\n\nLooking for a 7–10 year car in the ₹15–25L segment (₹5–10L down, ₹35k EMI, plan to clear loan in 2 years). Daily drive: \\~80–90 km in Mumbai. Must-haves: automatic, diesel preferred, ventilated seats, 360 cam, TPMS, cruise control, wireless CarPlay, good build, high ground clearance.\n\n**Shortlist:**\n\n1.

Would prefer something decently reliable. \n\nHere's what I've been looking at this far:\n- Mazda CX-5 or CX-8 ( petrol models, heard the diesels were unreliable)\n- P3 Gen Volvo XC-60 (T6 model only, 300hp and well regarded engine)\n-Toyota Vanguard (Rav4 with 3.5v6)\n- Lexus NX (upper limit of budget so probably can't get the hybrid)\n- Toyota Harrier (Similar to the current Venza but the slightly older JDM model 2014~)\n\n Any thoughts or suggestions?",

      "content": "Which 7 Seater EV would you choose? - Mitsubishi Outlander or Mercedes EQB? (Japan). We are currently looking into a 7 seater family car that can carry 6-7 people every few weeks.\nCurrent car is a top of the line 2015 Toyota Harrier (very comparable to Lexus RX450).\n\nThe family members are mostly Japanese and around 160cm tall (only the males are 180-190cm) and we have small children across our family and friends (0-6 years old)\nI’ve been to each dealer and I am a bit split.\n\nPros on EQB:\n- It feels high quality\n- The third row seats seem more comfortable from their quality\n- It has some nice features to help navigate the narrow streets of japan, where it can tell you on the screen with a simulation if you might hit a corner or not (we hit our Toyota a few times because we couldn’t properly see what we might be hitting)\n\n\nPros on Outlander:\n- Approx. $30k cheaper\n- A few features are better than EQB, such as 2nd row seat heating, better sound system (Dolby atmos) and other tiny things\n- Since it is a Japanese automaker and I am in Japan, it is fairly easy to get it serviced\n\n\nState of EV charging and lifestyle:\n- I can charge at home, either 3kw or could consider upgrading to 7kw\n- Around us are a lot of 40kw (or 50kw?) Chademo chargers if we need to charge a bit quicker\n- We would mostly drive up to 60km if we go out, rarely beyond that\n- Once or twice a year we might go for a 500km trip, anything longer than that we wouldn’t really take a car anyway\n- We drive approx 7000km per year\n\n\nSo I am now wondering about what the better buy is for the next 10+ years, in terms of issues and repair costs and everything.\nOr maybe even go with a cheaper (used car?) option and buy a new 7 seater earlier since they are still coming out.\n\nEDIT:\n\nI forgot there is also the Model X and Volvo CX90 Recharge. The Model X though I doubt works well in Japanese parking spaces due to its doors. The Volvo CX90 Recharge looks great, but not sure if it’s worth the price (costing twice the Outlander).",

Hi everyone,\n\nI recently bought a Nissan X-Trail (the hybrid/e-Power model) and unfortunately it’s been nothing but trouble. I’m now in the process of getting a refund from the dealer and I want to move on to something more reliable.\n\nI’m currently considering:\n- Toyota RAV4 \n- Kia Sportage\n- Hyundai Tucson\n\nHere’s what I’m looking for:\n- Reliability (after my X-Trail experience, this is #1 for me)\n- Comfort (daily driving but also long trips)\n- Boot space & interior room (I have dogs and often go up to the mountains, so I need good space for gear + pets)\n- Safety \n\nSome background:\n- In the past, I’ve owned a Nissan Qashqai, a Toyota Harrier, an older Toyota RAV4, and a very old Lexus. So I’m familiar with Toyotas but I’ve never owned a Hyundai or Kia before.\n- I want something practical but also enjoyable to drive — I don’t want to make another mistake like I did with the X-Trail.\n\nFor anyone who owns or has driven these cars, what would you recommend between the RAV4, Sportage, and Tucson?\n- Which is the most reliable long term ?\n- How do they compare for comfort and interior space?\n- Any common issues I should be aware of?\n- Best value for money ?\n\nWould really appreciate your advice before I make my decision. Thanks in advance!",

We have a 2019 Pilot so no need for a 3 row/mid-size which we will use for longer trips but gets horrible mileage around town (currently around 16mpg). Want something larger with similar MPG to my Civic that I will use locally and can also accommodate shorter trips with my husband and toddler. Decided on a compact Hybrid to fit that bill. Test drove CR-V Hybrid, Rav4 XSE (did not have a Limited for me to test drive), Venza base (again no inventory for me to test at Limited level) and Tucson Limited Hybrid. Did not like the CR-V or Rav4 but really liked the Venza and Tucson. I found both comfortable but liked the tech and cargo space on the Tucson more. So I'm leaning towards Tucson and have a refundable deposit on an incoming unit right now that's due in end of February but concerned about long-term reliability/resale. I can get both at MSRP but longer wait with the Venza since I'd have to order it and it's my second choice of the two I narrowed it down to. Any advice? Is Tucson a good choice? Any other suggestions in the 35MPG+ compact SUV segment? Thanks.",

As a result of this, for two months of the year, the road is flooded, muddy, slippery, and insane. For ten months of the year the road is concrete-hard, with thousands upon thousands of different sized stones and river pebbles baked into it, making it the bumpiest, hardest road on earth (before even discussing the corrugation)... and insane.\n\nIt took two years for this road to chew up and spit out a Toyota Hilux 3.0 D4D, and it took the road ten months to eviscerate a brand new Isuzu D-Max. So the question is, other than an insanely expensive 79 Series Land Cruiser, is there literally any vehicle on Earth than can handle these sorts of environments? We're frequently carrying 400kg - 600kg. Is is better to just get a used UniMog at this point?\n\nEdit: Since a few of you very helpful nut and bolt types have asked on message, [here's a short video](https://streamable.com/g8yioa) I took last night of the very beginning of the road when it's still really good! This section was graded last month, but if you turn the sound up you'll hear a good rattle already. You'll also see the right hand side of the road briefly which literally can't be driven on :). I know phone video never really gets the point across in these situations but enjoy anyway.\n\nEdit 2: This is as close to a post 'blowing up' as I've ever had. Thanks for all the really awesome feedback, I've actually learned a good amount more about suspension than I knew a few hours ago! Really cool community, hope you had as much fun as I have. Pro tip, if you haven't been to places like Zambia, Namibia, and Zimbabwe and these kinda roads interest you... what are you waiting for? The wildlife is astounding too! Hopefully catch one of you in your safari-converted Miata on a road here soon!",

I'm going to be driving across Canada and potentially into Central America over a period of several months. \n\nThe GMC Safaris I've found I absolutely LOVE, but they're all from around '98-00 and have an average of 380,000KM on them, which I've heard is pretty bad. \n\nGrand Caravans, Honda Odysseys and (to a lesser degree) Toyota Siennas have been floating around within my budget. What's the good, the bad, and the ugly, in your opinion? \n\n(Thank you all in advance)",

For the past five years me and my BMW 528 have cruised down 30 miles of well paved country roads and it's been easy. The BMW just ate up the miles.  Now, my commute has changed - now I have 20 miles of some of the worst interstate work I've ever seen followed by some of most pothole riven city streets in the state.  No place for BMW. This commute is going to kill it.\n\nSo, what do I buy?  Needs a tough suspension. My garage is smallish, so I don't want a full sized SUV.  Nothing too flashy, I don't want it stolen.  I've also gotten pretty used to the quality work of a BMW and hate to go too far backwards (love my heated seats, steering wheel and quiet ride).

It's got about 271k miles on it, and it could run forever or die tomorrow.\n\nLong term, the plan is to have 3 vehicles, a daily driver for us both and a shared utility/beater car.  I need to worry about the vehicle I use for work before I get a sporty project, so here we are.\n\nThis vehicle needs to tow at least 5k lbs to accommodate future camper trailer plans.  It also needs to accommodate a 6' person laying down in it.  I want the smallest and best handling vehicle that meets those requirements, as I'll be driving it primarily in the city, often down alleys.  Unless it'd make a good daily and is actually fun to drive, it should be <$5k, but I'll pay the price for the right thing.  I can work on it myself, older vehicles are fine.\n\nChevy Astro/GMC Safari currently top my list.  Wouldn't mind another pickup.  I'd love the Honda Element, but it can't pull the trailer, so I'd have to upgrade it someday.  Any ideas?",

The first car I drove at 16 was my grandfather's shitty old [Buick Century](https://static.cargurus.com/images/site/2009/03/23/19/54/2005_buick_lesabre_custom-pic-987-1600x1200.jpeg). Then I drove a hand-me-down [2-door 2000 Ford Explorer](http://o.aolcdn.com/commerce/autodata/images/CAB00FOS101A0101.jpg) for a few years. For the last few months I've been driving my dad's [2006 4-door Explorer](https://media.ed.edmunds-media.com/ford/explorer/2006/oem/2006_ford_explorer_4dr-suv_limited_s_oem_1_500.jpg). \n\nI'm now in the market to buy my first proper car. My parents have generously agreed to contribute around $10k. Anything beyond that is on me - I can certainly manage a few grand, but honestly looking around I'm pretty sure I can get a great car for not much over $10k.\n\nMe:\n\n* I'm about to graduate college and live in a city. As far as I know I'll be living here for a while, but of course it's hard to know for sure at this point in life. \n* I don't really like driving very much, but maybe that's because I've never had my own car to love. \n* I'm an engineer and am definitely mechanically minded, but have never worked much on cars. I'd love to learn.\n* I like camping and outdoors stuff every now and then, but don't go too often.\n* I'm a musician and may need to haul music gear.\n* I've only driven a stick shift on a handful of occasions, but buying one is not out of the question. I'm not sure if it would make me dislike driving even more, or make me have more fun.\n\nI actually really liked having the 2-door explorer, even though it's kind of an oddity. I've always liked smaller cars, and feel more comfortable driving them in the city because parking and maneuvering is so much easier. I liked that it had plenty of storage room if you put down the seats, but could fit 4 (or maybe 5) people when you had the seats up. I didn't like the full explorer because it's so big.\n\nWith those things in mind, I've been considering some 2-door cars with better-than-average storage space:\n\n* [~2010 Ford Focus Coupe](http://st.motortrend.com/uploads/sites/10/2015/11/2010-ford-focus-se-coupe-side-view.png).\n* [~2007 Scion tC](https://www.google.com/search?q=2000+ford+explorer&client=safari&rls=en&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiR35nNgqzUAhXJYyYKHbPcB98Q_AUICigB&biw=1039&bih=665#tbm=isch&q=2007+scion+tc&imgrc=y1MeogC-TxqbVM:). Is this thing worth it? People shit on Scion, but others say they're just rebranded Toyotas (and therefore are reliable).\n\nI've been told to stay away from European cars for reliability reasons as a first car and daily driver.\n\nAm I crazy to want a 2-door car? I know most people want coupes because they're sportier and are wannabe sports cars, but I really don't care much about that - I just don't really like hauling around more steel than necessary. Engineering mindset, I guess...\n\nMaybe y'all can give me some options for 4-door hatchbacks that don't feel too large. \n\nThanks for reading this long post.\n\nEdit PS: If I hadn't been warned against older European cars and guided towards practicality, I would still be looking at the BMW 3-series E30, either the sedan or coupe/vert.",

Good evening all,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am chasing my dream job as a teacher out in a remote Australian community and a prerequisite is owning a four wheel drive. The snag; I know embarrassingly little about cars and significantly less about 4x4's.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/md8uf9pozbv91.png?width=284&format=png&auto=webp&s=a5394dbf0241cb4dccacb7fdba25d68a93b5cb96\n\n**Budget:**\n\n$10,000-$17,500 (that's Dollaridoos btw)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Strategy:**\n\nThe conservative budget is due to my inexperience and the fact that I am humble enough to know that teachers out remote have a high bail rate. So while I think i've got the goods there is a significant chance I'll be returning to a major city where a safari snorkel is going to get limited use.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Current front runner:**\n\n2007 Land Rover Discovery 3 SE Auto 4x4 MY08\n\n333,000km Odometer\n\n6cyl 4.0L petrol engine\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Key features:**\n\nARB Bull Bar, Under body Armour, 115 litre Brown Davies Tank with electric transfer pump. Redarc brake controller, dual battery system including Anderson plug for solar charging, brand new kings driving lights, safari snorkel, rear draws, Also Recently fitted with Brand new original 4 coil air bag suspension including compressor and sensors, also a genuine electric hand brake assembly\n\n**Misc:**\n\n\\- Brake assist - Side airbags - Passenger airbag - Rollover stability control - Driver airbag - Rain Sensor Wipers - Premium Harman Kardon Audio sytem - Parking Sensors - Leather Trim -All In beautiful condition throughout\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo the question I'm asking really is what criticisms do you have of this car and my overall strategy?\n\nAm i significantly better off spending a bit more, or should this suffice in the short term?\n\nEdit: is it missing any essentials I didn't consider?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBless you and your apt automotive appraisals,\n\nMr X",

It's our third Golf GTI; we absolutely love them and have kept upgrading over the years. It especially made sense for the 10+ years that we lived in San Francisco. We split all costs evenly and take good care of it (pretty much just curb rash on the wheels and apart from that, it's as good as new, with 35K miles on it).\n\nRecently we moved from San Francisco to Sacramento and were gifted a 2003 GMC Safari cargo van by a family member. It has over 130K miles and has been treated just *okay.* It probably always passed smog, but there's interior/exterior damage, the windshield needs to be replaced, it's slow and clunky to operate, etc.\n\nBecause of COVID keeping us home all the time and in order to save money (we'll call it savings of about $550 a month), he wants to sell the Golf and use the GMC as our exclusive vehicle. We're not in dire straits or anything, this is just a cost-saving mechanism, but if we sell the Golf now, we would not be able to buy another vehicle for the foreseeable future.\n\nSo with this in mind, what are some fair arguments *against* his decision? Or if you're in agreement, what are some fair arguments *for* it? Anyone know of some sort of cost/benefit analysis exercise that I can do? Thanks.",

It runs well and no repairs are needed, I’m taking it to a mechanic tomorrow to confirm that it is mechanically sound. \n\nHere is my question. Am I overpaying for this van for the amount of miles on it? I am looking around Milwaukee, WI which means that all the vans have some rust on them. However, this Safari seemed to have minimal rust in the chassis compared to the other ones I’ve looked at. I want this van to last 5 years at least if I’m putting the work into it. Should I be concerned about the 150,000 miles on it? (AKA look for a van with lower miles?)\n\nMy plan is to build out this van to become a camper",

Hi Guys, \nI need a bit of advice if anyone can help me out :)   My gf and I are flying into LA in ten days and are hoping to buy a cheap van in or near LA (cash, $5000 budget), with enough room to sleep in the back and keep our stuff in while we travel.  A few questions a) at a used car lot is it the seller's responsibility to provide a smog certificate? aside from this and the 'pink slip', are there any other documents we need to be sure to receive with purchase, I have found these details a little hard to determine b) any miscellaneous tips for someone unfamiliar with the buying process in the US that may not be included in the buying guide in the side bar? c) Here's an example of what kinds of vehicles we are thinking of checking out when we arrive if you have any suggestions/warnings to add I'd appreciate it very much: https://www.cargurus.com/Cars/l-Used-1997-GMC-Safari-3-Dr-SLE-Passenger-Van-Extended-t5544#listing=145901840",

      "content": "Racism in car sales, or statistical fact?. I've been working as a salesman for 4 days now. One of the first things I noticed, was that most of the sales guys have a negative bias towards people of Indian descent. The apparent reasoning for this is because Indians are 9/10 difficult customers; they haggle, are mean or standoffish, yadayadayada. \n\nThe thing is, I actually served an Indian dude my 2nd day and we got along so well. He was a young guy looking for a 7-seater SUV for his family. I wasn't able to find the EXACT make model and year, but he thanked me for trying to help him. \n\nNow get this. Today, we had a sales meeting which the owner of the dealership himself was involved in. Every single critical sales manager was present. And after the serious meat of the meeting, they would casually throw in racist remarks about how to identify ways to improve our customer survey scores: \"don't hand them out to any Patel's\". Obviously they're not serious and to them they're kidding, but to me I find it racist.\n\nOn one hand, my morals is saying this is bullshit and racist. On the other hand, my logical side is reasoning that maybe, on some level, they were just speaking from their years of experience... Who would outwardly be racist for no reason?\n\nAnyway, thanks for reading my rant. Does anyone have any experience with this?",

I had an appointment to see a used car (that was listed for a price that was almost too good to be true) in another city about 2 hours away, but about a half hour out, I get a call from the dealer letting me know the car just sold (made perfect sense considering the price). As not to waste the driving I already did, I pull off the highway and poke around listings in that area and find the same model car, a year newer, with less mileage at a different dealer but for about $6k more. I end up walking in to see the other car, and it looks good so we start to negotiate price. \n\nThey aren't budging at all, only giving me $400 off, so I pull out the listing from the car that I know just sold, and tell them that although I like the car they have, their competitor 10 minutes down the street has the exact same car, slightly older, with more mileage, but for much cheaper and unless they can work with me on the price, I'm just gonna go buy that one instead. \n\nThey end up going back to their sales manager, and miraculously they can now sell the car to me with a $3k discount with new tires thrown in. \n\nWhen I told this story to my buddy who's a car salesman, he said it was a dirtbag move to leverage a car I know had already sold to get my deal. In my opinion, all's fair in love and car sales, and if they couldn't actually go lower on price they wouldn't have. Was this an shitty move on my part?",

      "content": "What was the game here?. This interaction has always bothered me as I felt it was a complete kick in the nuts so I’m here to ask the pros what the hell was up with this.\n\nSo I had a deal to buy a truck. Everything was verbally worked out and all I had to do was bring my truck to trade in and sign the paperwork. The sales guy, seemed new and nervous and zero knowledge on the new truck, but the price was good and the trade in was good so I wasn’t busting his balls and I was happy to have a good buying experience.  So I stayed up late to  clean out my truck and got up early to clean it out more before I traded it in. The salesman had asked me a few times to just give him a 10 minute heads up before I get there. So I drive 45 minutes and find a coffee shop 10 minutes away. I call the salesman and he goes on about how everything changed and the price of the truck went higher and the value of my trade went down and all this and that. I screamed at him and called him some bad names and I contemplated driving down there for a face to face but I just went home and called the manager and he said they would honor the original deal. But I was so pissed so I told them never mind. \nAnyway, would someone actually be ok with that tactic and go through with the purchase anyways? Is that a common tactic?",

      "content": "what do i do?. Look, had this guy come in yesterday telling me how he wanted a new 2025 Tacoma trd off road, said he had $10k down on spot, and was ready to buy. Obviously excited, sounds like a great deal. Took him out for a test drive, he loved it. Went inside to go look at the numbers, skeptical with the numbers, but i was willing to work on it with him. However, it was stuck on a 72 month term, why? Because he has bad credit, this is where things get rocky. I couldn’t extend the term obviously, but one thing that my sales manager told me was that it was going to be difficult trying to get him approved, he’s been to mutiple dealerships for the past year, which means his credit has been going down especially after all those credit apps. We tried getting him into a SR5, but that didn’t work out. so sales manager said, “yeah we can’t do anything about it.” I’m like hell nahh the guy has $10k down, with the income to back it up, i ain’t going to let this lead die just because we can’t get him approved. So i go ask one of the finance managers for help, he came up with another option, trying to get him approved onto a used vehicle, so then he could start building his credit. Thing is he had to wait to talk to another sales manager, due to him having connections with banks and other financial services. So come the next day, went up to my financial guy, and told me how they couldn’t get him approved onto anything, and that his only way of buying a vehicle is through buying cash only with those $10k. eliminating financing or even leasing, but even leasing wouldn’t do it due to the buyer traveling through city to city. I’m new and honestly been just trying my best out here to get these damn sales, it’s just tough when opportunity i have gotten are just supposed dead ends.",

The deceased had a duplicate title in Iowa in 1997, then transferred the car physically to Colorado. The car has been parked since then because it did not pass emissions and therefore was never titled in Colorado or registered. The car is being sold by the estate as is/parts. I am aware I will need to procure a bonded title for the car after a VIN inspection and state/national search. If I were to procure the bonded title, is it best to wait the 3 years CO requires before transfering to a clear title to sell the car or do any work on it (small things like carb rebuilds, brakes, wiring clean up?) I presume I could drive it somebover the waiting period and then the sellable value would increase dramatically once the title is clear.",

      "content": "Mistake on my lease agreement for yearly miles (NY). I know that I should have read the contract before signing so please don't throw that in my face, I was exhausted by the end of this and just trusted everything was in order. Will never make this mistake again.\n\nI leased a new Honda two days ago (I am located in NYC). The initial page stated the down payment options and the corresponding monthly payments. Under this it clearly states 12,000 miles per year. Negotiated the down payment down and a slightly lower monthly rate. We agree and I signed this paper on the bottom. When I get home I look at the contract and it says 10,000 miles. Not once did the dealer ever say that the mileage would be 10,000 a year. I went back today to get this corrected and he is giving me every single run around: 10,000 miles is standard for all leases, we overlooked all the damage on your old car, we gave you a better deal, we will overlook excess miles if you lease with us again. \n\nHe really pissed me off and was definitely gaslighting me. I asked to get a copy of the page that I signed with the deal we agreed on and he says that the finance agent has it and he was not in. I said but I was told by a manger yesterday he would be in. Dealer says  \"he didn't come in today and that paper is in his office so I don't have access to it\". I call BS. How do they not have a digital copy of all of this? I asked him are you guys going to look past up to 10,000 miles over my allowance because that is how much I will be over since I always drive close to 12,000 a year. Give it to me in writing with your signature and the GMs signature stating that will be fine and he says to just trust him and not worry. \n\n  \nThen he says to come back Monday when the finance agent will be in. So he was not in today and won't be in the next 3 days either??? I know he is full of shit because if the finance agent actually has that paper then he would have SEEN that the deal was 12,000 miles a year. Not once did he acknowledge that he did not verbally tell me the mileage would be 10,000. I told  him his lack of accountability for this one sided error is disgusting and lacking integrity and that I would be back. \n\nI know that lease agreements can be amended. This should not be such a huge issue so I do not understand why he is making this so difficult. I know in the end that they don't have to do shit to fix this since I did sign it, but do I have any recourse to force them to amend this? I am going to try calling Honda Corporate tomorrow. I am also calling the dealership first thing when they open and ask if the finance agent is in. If he is I am going to go straight there and say please give me a copy of the paper I signed for the deal we settled on since the dealer is saying you are the only one who has access to it.",

When purchasing the car, the dealer said they were going to handle all of the NJ registration. I left the lot with a 30 day temporary NY plate while waiting for my permanent NJ plates. \n\nIt’s been about 3.5 weeks and I still don’t have my NJ plates. I called the NJ MVC and they said they didn’t yet process the application (based off the car VIN) which could be due to either not yet receiving the application or because they get processed as they come in. \n\nI then spoke with the dealer in NY to confirm everything was done on their end which they did. I then asked about getting an extended temporary NY plate because my NJ plates aren’t ready and they said they don’t do that and it’s nothing I should worry about and if I get a ticket to give it to them. \n\nI’m no car expert, but my guess is that driving around with an expired temporary plate/registration is illegal. Should the NY car dealer be responsible to issue me a new temporary plate while waiting for the NJ plates?\n\nAny info or help would be appreciated. Thank you!",

      "content": "Worth it for daily driver? PPF & Ceramic Coating on a Black Civic. Hey everyone,\n\nI know this question comes up a lot, but I’m hoping to get some actual perspective from people who’ve gone either route.\n\nI just picked up a 2026 Honda Civic Sport Touring Hybrid Hatchback (black). Daily driver, parked outside year-round in the Cleveland/Pittsburgh area (so salt, snow, and sun exposure). I’ve been quoted locally by a shop that uses XPEL products:\n\nFull front PPF: ~$2,100 (bumper, hood, fenders, mirrors)\n\n10-year ceramic coating (with 1-year refresh): ~$2,200 (includes paint, wheels, plastics, and trim)\n\nSo all-in I’m looking at about $4,300 for both.\n\nFrom what I’ve read:\n\nPPF = best for rock chips, but limited coverage unless you go full-body.\n\nCeramic = easier washes, deeper gloss, less UV/fade, but still needs proper washing and maintenance.\n\nDIY sprays give you 70–80% of the “look” at a fraction of the cost, just with more frequent reapplication.\n\nI plan to keep the car least 5-10 years at least most most likely and drive max 10k miles/year.\n\nMy questions for those who’ve done this:\n\nFor a car like this (not a high-end sports car), did you find the pro ceramic worth it vs just using sprays yourself?\n\nIf you went with PPF, did you regret not doing ceramic too? Or vice versa?\n\nHow did your coating actually hold up after a couple winters?\n\nAny regrets either way?\n\nJust curious about the value vs convenience vs peace of mind from people who’ve lived with it.\n\nThank you in advance!",

Might as well start paying towards owning it. Anyone has done that?",

I'm currently in the market for a used car under a really tight budget ($2000-$4000) and saw a listing for a 2015 Toyota Camry Hybrid on Craigslist. The listing said that the engine and transmission are fine, but the battery needs replaced. The price is listed at $2000 and the body of the car looks fine. I was wondering if it's worth it to buy the car and replace the battery (I saw that Hybrid Toyota batteries run for $1500-2000 and I'd probably need someone to install it)\n\nI can look for other used car options. I just wanted to hear what other people thought about this.\n\nThank you!",

This has happened occasionally before, but I would move it into neutfal or back into park and it would crank. Is there a way to get my gear shift to move into neutral with it being stuck?\n\nEdit: My mechanic called me back and told me to check the fuses because it could be the fuse to the break interlock. It has been having electrical issues.\n\nThe gear shift finally released, and it only clicks and will not crank despite it being a strong battery connected to a jump box. All the dome lights and everything else work inside.\n\nThe fuel pump is engaging, so we can rule out the pump.\n\nEdit: AAA will not let me ride with them because of Covid-19. We tried renting a car from Hertz and Enterprise. They both do not deliver. There are also no Ubers or Lyfts in our area. The mechanic cannot look at a car, he cannot get.\n\nSolved: Although our Jeep does have seldom issues where I have to crank in neutral, this time it was because we recently had a battery connector replaced and parts of the ground wire had slipped out. I should have caught that,  but I was too frantic about my wife missing work. The good news is that it scared us into buying a nice car that was a good deal. Now we have two.",

You can get to that post via my profile or I may edit that in.\n\nI see some options on offerup for used Priuses/Priusi between $1600 and $3500 and I want to get your guys' opinion and hear what I should know before buying. I am under the impression that people typically buy these cars new, wear them out and that people do not typically sale them unless they have issues. Throwing KBB aside, what should I expect to pay for one? What do you think of these down below? What should I check? Do you have any haggling tips?\n\n1) 2007 Toyota Prius for $1600 on OfferUp https://offerup.co/P4iZC1D5P5\n\n2) 2007 Prius for $2500 on OfferUp https://offerup.co/TZpsvSI5P5\n\n3) 2006 Toyota Prius for $2000 on OfferUp https://offerup.co/EqYOgRN5P5\n\n4) 2005 Toyota Prius Clean Title 154k Miles for $2900 on OfferUp https://offerup.co/IYeU1RR5P5\n\n5) 2005 Toyota Prius for $3500 on OfferUp https://offerup.co/xwb7Ci15P5\n\n\nThese are just some examples. I may edit in more here if you think it is a good idea to look at more. #5 is wrecked on the side, but could it still be a good car and I use that to Haggle down the price? #1 is cheap, but the listing is three weeks old and it is still there. Might that indicate a problem?\n\nThank you in advance.",

I had one response so far, and I'm just hoping to get more of a general idea regarding my situation with my car.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI’m not sure what happened, but while driving I pushed it hard just for a quick pull, and then my car started to shake. My gears started to go all over the place, and the air/fuel ratio gauge went from 14-16 which is normal to nothing. It was literally \"------\" on the ratio.\n\nOpened up the hood to see this. [https://imgur.com/a/y0bxqoz](https://imgur.com/a/y0bxqoz)\n\nThe rubber that was holding the piece just blew off. There must have been so much pressure. My buddies told me they heard a few knocking sounds from there, and the engine is shaking a lot. Checked the oil and it’s still fine but it doesn’t matter. A lot of oil around it too.\n\nPlease any help?\n\nAlso a few hours later I decided to turn the car on when I got towed back to my garage just to see if I hear any knocking or thumping sounds. The car sounds fine on idle, and I didn't hear any misfirings or anything, or any odd idling sounds. The air/fuel ratio gauge now seems to be working. I'm hoping maybe I got away with not blowing a piston, but I don't know. I hope maybe it's just the PCV that was blown and just replace the hose too...\n\n[https://streamable.com/dja1ga](https://streamable.com/dja1ga)",

This could give you more bargaining power at the dealership.\n* **Research thoroughly.** Find out how much it usually costs to buy the car you want, considering insurance, registration and taxes. Then [learn what to look for in a used car](https://www.motormatcher.com.au/car-research/buying-used-car-find-out-what-check) or [how to pay less for a new car](https://www.motormatcher.com.au/car-research/buying-cars-online-5-essential-things-remember).\n* **Filter your search**. Narrow down your search by selecting a specific colour, price range, number of miles and brand.\n* **Find more options**. When buying from a dealership, your choices are limited to whatever is available on that lot. You have more choices when you go online and will still be able to view the car in person before you buy.\n\n## When to visit a dealership\n\nIf you don’t like online research or would prefer to talk to someone about your options, making a trip to a car dealership or two can help you compare your options. By going to a dealer, you could benefit from:\n\n* **Knowing the prices.** An Internet search may only return average prices for the vehicle you’re interested in if it’s not available online. By visiting a dealership, you can see the actual sticker price of the vehicle along with its features.\n* **Talking to an expert.** Salespeople know their business should be able to help you find a vehicle in their inventory that suits your needs.\n* **Comparing two or more dealers.** Although it might take more time, you’ll be better served to see the prices offered by a handful of dealers for equivalent vehicles.\n* **Test drive different options.** Visiting a dealer means you can test drive your options and find a car that’s comfortable for you.\n\nIn addition to shopping at a dealership, you’ll be able to start building a relationship. If you plan on buying multiple cars, having a dealership you trust with people you can count on can help you get better deals in the years to come.\n\n## When both make sense\n\nThe differences between shopping for a car online versus in-person balance out. You may find the best option is using both methods: Take the time to compare cars and financing online, then visit a dealership with an exact plan to face a sales pitch with confidence.\n\n## Where can I buy a car online?\n\nThe benefits of shopping online can vary based on the website you’re using. Each one is different, and one might suit your needs more than another.\n\n  \nThere are plenty of other websites geared to help you buy new or used cars but we recommend [www.MotorMatcher.com.au](https://www.motormatcher.com.au/) when buying a car online. Motor Matcher has the [Car Research Tool](https://www.motormatcher.com.au/car-research) that will help you answer all your car-related questions and will also help you learn more about buying cars online and even in dealerships. Motor Matcher also has the [Buy A Car Tool](https://www.motormatcher.com.au/buy-car) that will help you with browsing for cars that is available on the website.",

      "content": "What else do I need besides a compressor to install AC on my '96 Jeep Laredo?. The previous owner removed the compressor and installed a bypass. Can someone give me a list of things I may need and give me a heads up about whether the installion may require specialized tools to which an average Joe may not have access?\n\nI am looking to do as much as I can myself. Also, What is the difference between a $300 compressor and a $500 compressor? For reference, I have been looking on Autozone's website for one's guaranteed to fit my vehicle.\n\nEdit: I found these two kits. What is the difference between the two except for the prices?\n\nhttps://m.autozone.com/cooling-heating-and-climate-control/a-c-kit/four-seasons-kit-a-c-compressor-d0132/730237_1330831_34477?aqs=\n\nand\n\nhttps://m.autozone.com/cooling-heating-and-climate-control/a-c-kit/santech-kit-a-c-compressor-p96-26304/479596_924455_34477?aqs=\n\nA picture is worth a thousand words, so please include pictures or links with pictures in your replies if you can. I am dealing with autozone as my primary local supplier, so links from there would be great.\n\nI found a condensor in case I need one, but it does not come with a dryer. I tried looking on autozone.com, but either I am not searching for it right or the bad internet will not load it.\n\nAre there any other parts I need?\n\nHow can I vaccum the line? Do I have to go to an AC shop or can I rent a tool for it?\n\nIt would probably help to know that this was a Michigan car even though we are in NC now and the rust sure shows it.\n\nSo far, the worst case scenario list is...\n\n1) Compressor Replacement Kit $273.99\n2) AC Condensor $112.99\n3) ACDelco Serpentine Belt $44.99\n\nRought Total $431.97\n\nWhat about line replacement???? Do I need to replace them or can they be cleaned? I read that dirt and debris can clog up a compressor. Will flushing the system fix this? How do I flush the system.\n\n\nP.S.\nThe pictures do help a lot. I am pretty good about getting things back together if I can see it. I did reassemble all the parts to two car legs before, but I plead the fifth when it comes to knowing about cars. I have a ways to go yet. Thank you for your responses thus far. They are very helpful.\n\n2nd Edit: I rented a vacuum at Autozone and I had the guy at Autozone look at it and he could not find the high pressure line or condensor. It is very likely that it was removed when the previous owner installed the bypass.\n\nCan I still put a vacuum on the low pressure line just to clean the system?",

      "content": "2016 Dodge Charger good buy?. The specific car in question is here:  [https://www.cars.com/vehicledetail/detail/807549799/overview/](https://www.cars.com/vehicledetail/detail/807549799/overview/)\n\nI've emailed the dealer to get more information, but I was curious if any knowledgeable people here could give me some information regarding if it's a good buy or not. I looked at the vehicle report attached to the VIN, but I don't know what a lot of it means.\n\nWhat I do know is they're asking significantly less than the Kelley Blue Book fair market value for this specific type of car. $10,990 compared to $15K+. The only thing I can tell immediately that would bring the price down so much is that it was stolen and recovered and probably carries a salvage title from the insurance company even though they claim no damage was done to the vehicle. Along with that, the report stated there was a minor dent and/or scratches which I haven't seen in the pictures.\n\nI'm hardly an expert, and I know not everyone is a fan of Dodge in the past several years. I'm sure simply buying Japanese would be the advised thing to do. (I've driven a 2000 toyota camry for the last 7-8 years). I'm just curious, as long as everything is mechanically sound, would this charger be a good buy?",

I don't care at all about appearance, speed, or cosmetic things. I don't care about size except internal room would be nice so I don't bump my head on the ceiling. I would prefer to buy used because I don't like the idea of new cars depreciating in value so quickly, but I could be open to it if there's an affordable option and if the benefits outweigh buying new somehow.\n\nBased on cars I've seen, I like Honda Civics and Priuses because they meet my goals of internal space, affordability, and reliability. \n\nWhat would be a good year/price/mileage for these models? Are there other cars that I should consider? How can I learn more about what kind of car will fit my needs? Would it be better to buy new? I would appreciate any help with my questions, thanks!",

      "content": "Protect Yourself When Buying A Car During Coronavirus Pandemic. Buying a new car at this time may not be on top of everyone's mind right now but the fear of coronavirus should not stop you from doing so. \n\nJust as you are buying a car without the coronavirus in the picture, you should look for a car that matches your budget and your needs. \n\nSo, what steps should you take to protect yourself when buying a car during the pandemic?\n\nDo **Online Research** \n\nOnline research is at most useful amidst the current quarantine and social distancing rules.  But as with online shopping, you can do so much when buying a car online. Here are a few tips to guide you: \n\n* Start with the right website to find the right car for you.\n* Check for car reviews and rankings to help you answer questions about the car you want to buy.\n* Narrow down your car choices.\n* Once you’ve found the right car that meets your criteria, start contacting the seller or the dealership.\n* Check for the car’s price negotiability.  \n\n**Consider Home Delivery**\n\nDelivery home option is a great way to minimise risk and contact with the disease. There are dealers that offer concierge service and deliver the car straight to your garage. \n\n**Ask for Dealerships Precautionary Measures**\n\n Know how the car dealership is taking the coronavirus and what they are doing against the virus. Are they practising social distancing? Do they have safety guidelines pertaining to hand washing, disinfecting and handshaking? \n\n**Disinfect Before Doing Any Test Drive**\n\nThe virus can thrive on surfaces for hours up to 3 days. In case of a car, it's best to see it as any other public space that can get infected.\n\nWipe the car down by yourself with a disinfectant and be extra careful with high-touch surfaces such as key fobs, seats, steering wheels, gear shift, seat belt buckles, controls, touch screens and other surfaces.\n\n**Practise Social Distancing**\n\nWhen it's necessary to go to a dealership, sanitise yourself before entering and maintain 6 feet away distance from others. For now, you should refrain from shaking hands but and air hand shake is still acceptable.  As an additional preventive measure, you might also want to bring your pen to sign the necessary documents.   \n\nTo conclude, buying a car, even in the age of coronavirus pandemic is still possible.   The fundamentals remain the same  but you need to take extra precautions to avoid catching the virus.  Fortunately, the internet is overflowing with resources for both new and used cars. So stay at home and take advantage of that.",

      "content": "Parents inlaw killed my car. So I had this lovely car I got second hand for $8000. Well I got pregnate and because of my hight I couldn't reach the gas/break pedals because of my growing belly. So my mil was driving me to work for $30 a day in her car, Which I was fine with. Well their truck broke down and my FIL needed it for work. So I told him that he could borrow my car until they could afford to get a new truck....my mistake. The deal was he fixed a few minor issues with it and he can use it (he's a macanic). He agreed and so did my MIL. Problem is when he went to buy a few parts my MIL refused to hand over the money. (Note that I was still paying her gas AND I was paying the $200 insurance on a car I wasn't driving. I thought the deal was fair. Well. Now I'm without a car and my MIL blames me for it. Problem is I told them if they couldn't afford the parts to let me know and I'd pay for them. But they said they got it. I didn't find out they did nothing to the car until after I got it back and they told me. And they refused to help at all. So yeah. I got used and it's my fault.\nEdit: It's destroyed to the point where it's unusable now. They let the parts get to the point of rot. Before they were fixable and now it needs all new parts. And some more parts as a result of those parts going unfixed. It won't even start now, not even when jumped. He also put a fake inspection sticker on it, and told me it was fake.\n\nI just want to know if I'm crazy for being mad",

When coasting the car does not shake, only when accelerating. It starts around 25 it’s really bad between 30-50. Car still drives and shifts correctly otherwise, I’ve replaced the tie rods and control arms so far and for a little bit it was better but it’s just as bad again. from what I can tell the hub assembly is fine there’s no play in my wheels or anything. I’m not sure if it could be a tire issue or another issue entirely, recently while accelerating around 40 I can hear a light thump in the passenger tire which is a new issue.",

I'm looking for a forever car for my daily commute, but I'm stuck in analysis paralysis after 3 months of searching.\n\n**My Basics:**\n\n* **Budget:** ₹5–10L down, ₹35k EMI max (loan closed in 2 years). \n* **Usage:** \\~80–90 km daily in Mumbai (mix of city + highway). \n* **Ownership:** Plan to keep 7–10 years.\n\n# The Contenders:\n\n**Citroën Basalt**\n\n* **Pros:** Stunning coupe design, fantastic drive, feels unique.\n* **Cons:** Citroën's future in India. Just ONE service center for all of Mumbai/Navi Mumbai/Thane (40km from my home). Am I buying a future nightmare?\n\n**Tata Safari/Harrier**\n\n* **Pros:** Unmatched road presence, premium feel, great diesel AT.\n* **Cons:** Worried about Tata's long-term reliability and niggles. Selecting this stretches the budget.\n\n**Honda Elevate**\n\n* **Pros:** Bulletproof Honda reliability and service network. Total peace of mind.\n* **Cons:** The drive felt competent but totally uninspiring. I don't want to feel \"meh\" about my car for a decade.\n\n**Nissan Magnite / Renault Kiger**\n\n* **Pros:** Amazing VFM. Loaded with features, fun turbo engines.\n* **Cons:** Same as Citroën – will the brands even be in India by the time I'm done with the car?\n\n**The Logic: Tata Nexon**\n\n* **Pros:** Objectively checks every box for safety, features, and value.\n* **Cons:** Inspires zero passion in me. It feels like settling.\n\nIt feels like a choice between a car I'll love and a car that's just practical. What would you do?\n\n**TL;DR:** Need a 10-year car for a long Mumbai commute. My heart loves the risky Citroën Basalt. My head leans towards the impressive but potentially niggle-prone Tata Harrier/Safari. Logic points to reliable but boring options.",

      "content": "Considering Buyback Branded Title Purchase. Hi! \nI've seen some similar posts, but nothing super recent and was hoping for feedback from people who have personally purchased a manufacturer buyback branded title vehicle.\nI'm looking at a 2022 Ford Bronco Sport Badlands with 21k mi, KBB says $29750 and I'll have it OTD at $26k. It still has 3 yrs left on the manufacturer powertrain warranty and the dealership is offering a 12mo/12k mi bumper to bumper warranty on it as well.\nThis vehicle did not have a recurring problem and is not a lemon-- the transmission failed and due to supply chain issues a new one couldn't be obtained in a reasonable amount of time so Ford offered to buy it back. The dealer supplied me with full service and repair history and CarFax before the test drive.\nMy biggest concern is the financing! I have excellent credit, but I've heard the interest rates for these cars is significantly higher (salesman told me it would be higher but not by much). Can anyone tell me what lender they found that would finance and what your interest rates look like?\nFor reference, I was pre-approved with Capital One at 6.07% for the same car with clean title. I'm located in NC.\nTIA!",

Update on my previous post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/carbuying/s/mthh4uHyv0](https://www.reddit.com/r/carbuying/s/mthh4uHyv0)\n\nGot a call today saying they were irked by the way their manager handled it yesterday and went around them to their GM. They want to move cars and they will do it for $32.5k.\n\nI responded by saying I have another dealer who is giving me the same offer (true), but I don't appreciate having to head over for this car for the third time. Yesterday was painful because I was very close to pulling the trigger. So I said, if you give it to me for $32k out the door I will leave work and sign right now.\n\n5 min later they call back and said they'll do it. Heading there now.\n\nThank you everyone for your input and hope this was entertaining/insightful.\n\nUPDATE:\n\nI have the car and it was legitimately $32k everything included. Great deal, good salesman.",

My main concerns I have are how long the car will last, whether it is safe, and whether it has Apple CarPlay (although for this one I already know it does).

From the Indica and Nano days to Curvv Nexon and Harriey an actual AWD EV with 600+ km range and sleek design. Kinda proud moment ngl for a person who admires Tata motors (have a good past experience as well)😄\n\nI know it’s early and not many test drives are out yet, but the specs look solid – dual motor setup, 14.5” touchscreen, ADAS, and even a 540° camera. Feels like Tata is really pushing boundaries here.\n\nWould love to know what are your first impressions?\nDo you think this EV can give some serious heat to the MGs and Mahindras out there?",

I knew Tata usually does well with safety, but this one’s not even launched yet, I remember casually checking out the EV version at a display a while ago and thinking “looks futuristic but probably gonna take ages to prove itself.” But now with this rating… it’s kinda setting expectations real high before even hitting the roads.\n\nAlso does this mean the safety structure is completely different from the ICE Harrier or is it built off the same base? I get confused with these things.\n\nCurious to hear what you all think especially from the safety-first crowd here.",

      "content": "Need Help : Dealership experience. Hi everyone,\n\nJust wanted to share my extremely disappointing and frustrating experience with JP Motors – Tata Car Dealership in Solan, Himachal Pradesh, and Tata Motors itself. I had booked a Tata Harrier Adventure Plus Dark Edition in June, but what followed was a series of mismanagement, lies, and unethical behavior — and now I’m stuck chasing a refund of ₹21,000 that I paid in advance.\n\n**It started in Nov 2024...**  \nI first visited JP Motors in November 2024 because I was genuinely interested in the Harrier. But my experience at the dealership was immediately bad — no one attended to me for a long time, and even when I got someone to talk to, they didn’t have a Harrier available for test drive.   \nAfter several follow-ups, I was finally told to come down for a test drive, but when I reached the showroom (having left work and asked my father to take time out too), they casually said \"the battery is dead\" — completely unprepared and unprofessional.  \nDespite this, I still liked the car and was willing to give it another shot. Later, the salesman arranged a test drive for my father (when I was out of town), and he liked the car. So I went ahead and made the booking on 5th June 2025, paying a ₹21,000 advance.\n\n**Delivery Promised in 20–25 Days... and Then the Delays Started**\n\nI was told the car would be delivered by end of June, so I planned my leaves accordingly as I work out of town.  \nBut not once did the dealership call us for updates. We had to call them ourselves every few days — and each time we were given a new excuse and new delivery date:  \n2nd July → 10th July → 14th July → 16th July → finally 17th July  \nAnd for a long time they kept telling us our car was in transit when it was not even alloted from plant yet which we got to know later.  \nOther excuses included \"car not allotted,\" \"truck breakdown,\" \"vehicle stuck in transit,\" etc. We had zero clarity, and the dealership kept lying about the car’s status.  \nThis also disrupted our other plans which we planned according to their initial committed date\n\n**What Happened on Delivery Day (17th July) Was Unbelievable**\n\nOn 17th July, they told us the car had arrived and asked us to come see it. We went to the yard and saw the car being unloaded — and to our shock, it was dirty from inside.  \nThey said they would clean it, do PDI, and bring it to the showroom. So we waited.When we got tired of waiting, we went to the workshop, and that’s where things got completely unethical.  \nWe found an employee rubbing black paint with a cloth on the car. When asked, he said he was “doing final touches.”  \nBut this was clearly being done to hide scratches and defects. And even after that, we found a big dent and multiple scratches on the car.  \nNo one informed us about this instead when i confronted them about rubbing black paint on car they just blatantly refused to acknowledge that — they were just trying to quietly cover it up and hand over the car.\n\n**That Was the Last Straw – I Cancelled the Booking Immediately**\n\nThis was beyond unacceptable. I had waited over 6 weeks, been lied to repeatedly, and then was almost handed over a damaged car with cover-ups.  \nSo I cancelled the booking immediately on 17th July and submitted a written cancellation letter. I was told I would get the ₹21,000 refund within 7 days.\n\n**I Also Wrote a Formal Complaint to Tata Motors – No Response Till Date**\n\nOn the same day, I sent a detailed email to [customercare@tatamotors.com](mailto:customercare@tatamotors.com) with everything — including photos of the workshop scene and the advance receipt.That was 10 days ago. No one has replied. No acknowledgment.This is shocking even from a brand like Tata.\n\n**Refund Still Not Issued**\n\nEven thought the cancellation letter with all facts was submitted on 17th July I still havent recieved my refund.  \nWhen I follow up with the dealership, they just say:  \n\"We’ll do it by end of the month.\"  \n\"Money is with company not with us,it takes time\"  \n\"Our owner is not here\"\n\nIt’s been over a month since I paid the advance, and over 10 days since cancellation, and they are just refusing to return my money on time.  \nWhat should I do next? Any suggestions are welcome — whether it’s raising a complaint with consumer forum, legal route, or any Tata escalation channel that actually works.",

When I checked mine, I found that it's of Jan 25. \n\nThe problem is I've made full payment and sent for registration as I was not aware of this check. \n\nWhat are my options? Can I request for a different car even after registration? \n\nUrgent help required as we are going to the showroom tomorrow.",

Although oem touch screen (7 in) is there but it does not support cameras and also does not have carplay/android auto. I dont want android stereo. Oem sound quality is very good.\n\n2. I want a good dual channel dashcam also.\n\n3. Any reliable gps tracker. OBD based ones like jiomotive are useless in name of security.\n\n4. I don't want to change/alter oem wiring.\n\n---- is there any solution that can give me android auto/carplay, reverse camera, dual dashcam all in one.\nI am attaching photo of dashboard also.\n\n5. Is there any solution that can work as reverse cam, carplay/android, dual channel dashcam.\n\n6. Car seat- i have basic fabric seats. Don't want to spoil oem seats by bucket fitting gimmick (taking out Tubes and placing in new seat cover). However, open to the method in which needle and thread used to give bucket fit effect.\nBest options for seat cover materials.\n\n7. Floor matting? And which one to get?\n\n8. Any auto dimming irvm solution?\n\n9. Grainy texture of dashboard. Cannot use suction cup type mobile holders. Suggestions if any, tried car vent type once but placement is low.\n\nThanks in advance.",

Manual transmission would be too much effort in city traffic so going for an automatic.I have narrowed down the choices to Mahindra 3XO AX5L Automatic (12.25 lakhs ex-showroom after discount and GST reduction) and Skoda Slavia Sportline 1.5 DSG Petrol (15.3 lakhs ex-showroom after discount and GST reduction). 3XO is a proper 5 seater for adults but with limited bootspace, Slavia has better bootspace but is comfortable for 4 adults and a kid.\n\nAfter the GST cut, diesel Automatic variants of Scorpio N, XUV700, Tata Safari with 6 airbags and other necessary features are available within 18L ex-showroom post discount, which I have the budget for. They supposedly give 12-13 kmpl in city, 18-20 kmpl on highways. They offer a lot of rear seat space as well as boot space when you are not using the 3rd row. Thinking about using it as a 5 seater most of the time which can accommodate more people if required, like extended family visiting. Thinking about Diesel so the mileage isn't bad for a big car. \n\nI would be using the car for office travel in Bangalore's bumper to bumper traffic twice or thrice a week. Will be going out on weekends with family but in the city itself. Will be travelling with family on occasional long trips (within 500 KMs mostly).",

I have narrowed down my options  between Xuv700 AX7 Diesel AT, Tata Safari Adventure Plus Diesel AT ,  Hycross GXO,  considering MG Windsor aswell, (though kids want a 3 row car) but my brother just purchased a ScorpioN Diesel AT so won't be a big deal going for Windsor either (can swap it with my brother when/if required)..kids haven't seen Windsor yet.\n\nI'd like to have an opinion what would best suit my needs..the car would be used as a secondary car, my daily/primary car is a Creta Diesel AT, and I have a daily run of 50-60kms and one-two  trips a month of about 500-600kms..n this car would become my primary car down the line.\n \nLooking for a feature rich no fuss car, looking at the car scrapping policy by the govt, I wish to go for the GXO( pretty moderate interiors n features), but what I dread with the Hycross is it's fuel efficiency..some say it's as low as 8-10..Views and advice would be appreciated.\nThanks..!!",

      "content": "Visit to Sanjay Gandhi National Park (SGNP) : Everything you need to know!. I'd been meaning to visit SGNP for ages, and finally, I made it happen! Let me tell you, it didn't disappoint.\nThis post is my way of paying it forward, giving you all the details you need to plan your own incredible SGNP adventure.\n\n\nTotal Cost ~\nIncluding travel, camera, food, and entry and exploration fees - Approximately 899₹ per person\n\n\nNow let me elaborate...\n\n\nTravel ~\nMetro (very convenient)\nVersova-Western Express Highway-Rashtriya Udyan\n(40₹+60₹ - one way)\nIt is a 4-5 mins walk from the metro station\n\n\nSGNP Entry Fees - 103₹\nCamera Charges - 285₹\n\n\nFrom here you have many options to explore the national park -\n\n—>Bus (50₹) (AC) (includes return) We took this bus, really comfortable, highly recommend it if you have less time on your hands, Takes 20 minutes to go and 20 minutes to return, and stops at Lion and Tiger Safari and Boating while returning.\n\n—> BEST Bus (AC) (14₹) (includes return) This is a good option too but the windows are smaller so the scenic route is something you will miss out on.\n\n—> Cycling (45₹) Rent cycles from the park itself, not from outside, I would only recommend this mode of transport if you have the stamina to ride for 7kms to Kanheri Caves, It's not a very straight route, If you are not visiting Kanheri, Cycling short distances is a good idea.\n\n—> Walking, Again, If you are not planning to go to Kanheri, You can stroll around, go Boating, go to the Butterfly Garden, Fragrance Garden, etc.\n\n\nOnce you reach the Kanheri Caves entrance don't forget to try these out from the stalls\n—> Star Fruit (20₹) 8.5/10\n\n—> Watermelon (30₹) 9/10\n\n—> Chana Masala (30₹) 10/10\n\n—> Love Apple/White Jamun (20₹) 7/10\n\nWe were enjoying the beautiful Kanheri Caves when a cheeky monkey decided our starfruit and jamun looked like the perfect snack.  He wasn't wrong, they were delicious! 😉\n\n\nKanheri Caves ~\nEntrance Fees\n\n—> Indian Citizens - 25₹\n\n—> Foreign Citizens - 300₹\n(really unfair.)\n\nThere are 3 trails you can follow to explore Kanheri Caves. There are a total of 109 Caves, really beautiful and intricate. You can explore as many as you can and wish to till 5:30 pm. We were there for 1 hour.\n\n\nLion and Tiger Safari ~\nWe got down and took the bus to go back to the main entrance, stopping at the Lion and Tiger Safari (136₹). It is a 25 to 30-minute ride going and coming.\nThe lions were sleeping, so didn’t get to see much there, but a tiger was walking right outside our bus and it was so magnificent.\nThere were other tigers too but were resting inside, probably because it was afternoon time (1 pm)\n\n\nAfter this safari, we got on the bus to take us back towards the main entrance, it stopped for people who wanted to get down for boating, but we didn’t have much time on our hands so skipped that, but it looked pretty fascinating.\nSo yes, even tho we didn’t explore everything, whatever we did in 3 hours was worth it. Really fun especially if you are going with your partner or your friends.\n\n\nTips and Tricks ~\n\n—> Carry cash, there is no network at many places and therefore online transactions do not go through.\n\n—> Carry at least one bottle of water especially if you plan on walking/cycling/going to Kanheri Caves\n\n—>  Wear sunglasses/cap, it gets quite sunny after 10 AM.\n\n—> Wear comfortable walking shoes.\n\n—> Rent Cycles inside SNGP, not from outside the park as they overcharge as well as scam you sometimes from what is known.\n\n—> Carry snacks/food of your own choice if you are planning to spend an entire day there, if not, they do have titbits such as fresh fruits, chana masala, pav bhaji, etc.\n\n\nSanjay Gandhi National Park is a true gem in Mumbai's crown.  I hope you enjoy your visit as much as I did!",

Been a long time lurker of this sub but never thought I'd be using it for this purpose anyway the  conundrum I have is pretty complex to me and this is pretty much my last resort so here goes nothing. So I'm a transportation designer who graduated a year back and I'm in the process of completing my portfolio which is where the issue starts and ends, so to explain the problem I will need to provide some context, I have a limited time frame to complete my portfolio and as for the deadline my visa expiries in Jan '23 so will have to finish something or have something concrete before the year ends. I have to do a bunch of concept cars in that duration and that's what really confusing to me, I have this one shot at completing my portfolio with concepts that both make sense and show my skill in all mediums be it 2D, 3D, visualization and the pressure of doing it right correctly along with it being my only opportunity to do it makes me feel confuse on which concepts I should do and for which brand. I have my own personal preferences and down below I will share the list of what I have and what I want to do, ultimately I'm afraid I won't make the right choice and I know I will only know if I try but I really don't want to stir the philosophical pot, just want to do logical reasoning with someone who knows a bit about design or automotive or just knows what they are talking about. \n\nI have 2 concepts \"ready\" at the moment and a third one is one I'm doing with someone so not worried about that. I need around 5 more concepts and really confused on what to pick. The two I have are a Hyundai 2027 Supercar concept  and a Polestar 2035  hyper car concept and the other one being a Suzuki 2035 SUV. I have a liking towards French manufacturers so I want to do something for Citroën and Bugatti, for the former one I have a vision gran Turismo type ( single seater) idea as it has not been done for Citroën and I'm confused as to what I can offer for the latter one considering all this one thing that sticks out is most of the concepts are all fast looking aggressive cars so to offset it will need to do something mobility driven or living room on wheels type. I have a Faraday Future mobility concept that I could work on but it offers pretty much nothing new. All in all I'm pretty sure you're confused too with this horrible structure but I honestly don't know how to explain this and talking to my friends or fellow designer doesn't help either because of the competitive nature of it or simple they cant relate to the issue. Having a mentor would help but I don't have the liberty to have one or the time to pursue one. \n\nhere's the following list of what I have the options for but no clue on what to pursue. \n\nFerrari Testarossa concept  \nHyundai 2027 Northstar - Northstar GT4 - ✔  \nBMW M9 - M9 GT3  \nCitroen G0 vision GT  \nPolestar HYPCR 2035 - ✔  \nPolestar GT - GT Performance  \nSuzuki KUMA - Urban & Trail  \nSuzuki NEXA Ronin  \nFaraday future FFT  \nPorsche Dakar - safari - safari turbo  \nNASA Roborace 2035 - Mk01 / Mk02  \n100m Yatch  \nGAC design mobility  \nBugatti(?)  \nAudi 2035 RS6 \n\nAny suggestions or addition to the list helps. Thank you for your time.",

During my recent road trip covering several important locations, the experience on the stretch between Mumbai and Dahanu was disappointing due to poorly planned road concretisation. The journey, which began at 5:15 AM from Mumbai, took more than 6 hours just to cross the Gujarat border, despite only a single halt for breakfast near Virar. The road construction work was chaotic, with uneven surfaces and poorly managed diversions, creating significant delays and discomfort.\n\nHowever, once I entered Gujarat, the driving experience improved remarkably. The roads were well-maintained, allowing smooth travel through various destinations:\n\n\t•\tDahanu Mahalaxmi Temple\n\t•\tPoicha Swaminarayan Temple\n\t•\tStatue of Unity along with the Jungle Safari\n\t•\tPavagarh Mahakali Temple\n\t•\tDakor Ranchodrai Temple\n\t•\tManilaxmi Jain Tirth\n\t•\tVadodara Atladara Swaminarayan Temple\n\nThe difference in road quality between Maharashtra and Gujarat was striking, with Gujarat’s infrastructure providing a hassle-free driving experience. Despite the frustrating start, the overall trip was enriching, covering spiritual sites, cultural landmarks, and scenic attractions, concluding back in Mumbai.",

      "content": "Went to Karnala Fort trek and this is how it felt. Was scrolling Instagram and saw a video of someone doing Treks. Felt an urge to climb some hill so I looked up online about neighbouring treks(I live in Airoli) and found Karnala Fort trek could be done in a day. \n\nWithout any further research, I did this:\n\n-Got on a local train to Panvel.\n-Took an auto to Karnala Fort trek base directly from Panvel station. (Costed me ₹300)\n- Purchased ₹60 entry ticket and started right away. \n- 3 hours to reach the top, chilled for an hour up there, 1.5 hours to reach back to the base.\n- took a shared van and headed back to panvel station \n\n\nI had to step out solo because my friends are lazy 😞\n(Also I should have done breakfast before starting :( )\n\n\n\n\nIf someone's interested in reading this excited ass's trek experience and can read longggggggg descriptions, here's this: \n\nWell, I am not a trekker (At least not yet), though I lie to my friends that I am just to aura farm and to convince them that treks aren't difficult 😁. I had done one trek before (Parasnath trek)and that was a long and exhausting one but not difficult because they made concrete roads all the way to the summit. Being a beginner, I didn't find Karnala Fort trek difficult.\n\nSo, at the base, you'll see a couple of boards describing the biodiversity of the place, which is also a bird sanctuary. It does have a lot of bird species, I could hear chirping all along but couldn't spot much since I didn't have binoculars. \n\nThe trail was Rocky, a lil slippery since it's monsoons, but well marked and safe if one's careful. Also you'll find people in groups and it's not lonely at all. Since the start of my climb, I encountered a lot of monkeys. They didn't do anything, but idiot me was taking out something from the bag and one baby monkey saw a biscuit packet and tried to snatch. I got rid of it gently cause it's their territory and didn't want to piss them off.\n\nNow there were benches and sheds in like every 20 minutes of climbing so resting wasn't a problem. In around 10 minutes of my trek, I met with a guy who came there solo and then he joined me. He was a 2nd yr college student so wasn't much younger. Throughout the trail, I spotted around 10 crabs, cool looking mushrooms on rotting wood, and some 15-20 butterflies. \n\nMidway, you'll start hearing water flowing. And then there'll be a small stream where you could rest for a while. Then the upwards journey will start feeling a little tougher than before because of bigger rocks. If you are careful, there won't be any problems at all. A guy from another group (who were kinda over enthusiastic), was showing off his jumping skills, tripped and broke a jaw. \n\n2/3rd, there was a flat dirt track, and then the trek got easier. At this point , I could see the beautiful terrain of the place and the scenic surroundings were amazingly beautiful. After few more minutes I reached a point where the view was so impressive that I waited and took a whole bunch of pics. \n\nNow it was almost to the Fort. From here it was occasional climb( though steep) and more of walking dirt tracks with long grass besides. Here there were a lot of butterflies and bees and it looked lovely. Reached the fort and the view was superb. The breeze was so good that I wanted to take a nap out there. Enjoyed there for about an hour and then headed back. \n\nThe journey downhill was pretty easy. Took me way lesser time. Midway, I rested near that water stream again and this time I put my feet in the cold water. It was so soothing and like some pain killer for my foot. Reached the base, less exhausted and more hungry and there weren't any eateries in that area. That's it. \n\nAlso, if someone's planning to do this trek, do carry a 1L water bottle and chocolates or something cause you won't find food around there. If someone has read till this. Thank you for your time :)",

It’s not just an inconvenience anymore, it’s a serious issue of health and dignity.\n\nI want to get a proper toilet inside the house itself, but I have no idea how to go about it.

Sounds fair right? But here’s the story. I ordered it couple weeks ago for the new place I would be staying at. They showed 2 weeks to deliver but delivered in 1 1/2 weeks. During which I went to parents because my mom got hospitalised and then she passed away. I forgot all about this shit until yesterday, when I came back and opened their packages. Found out they delivered wrong mattress cover. All I asked for is replacement that too because it’s the wrong size and they rejected flat out even after I told them what happened. You get nothing as customer, if they delay you’re supposed to be understanding and wait patiently. If your family dies, you are supposed to open the packages on time and check them. Or else it’s your fault. Never buy from such soulless brands or You’ll be someday in my position too\n\nEdit : \n\nIt’s about cover that was never opened and was sent in wrong size not mattress, that person receiving delivery can easily see size of. I don’t want the resolution from them anymore just to save their face. They already showed me what kind of brand they are. Fortunately I can stomach the loss of few thousands. I’m gonna cut and throw that shitty cover. I’m returning mattress and throwing away/donating their pillows too whichever is feasible since I don’t want anything from such shitty brand in my home. I just wanted to share my experience so everyone know what to expect from them.",

      "content": "Porter delivery service is a scammy experience – beware!. I just had one of the worst experiences with Porter’s All India Parcel service and I feel people should be warned before trusting them.\n\nHere’s what happened:\n\n* I booked a parcel shipment (Booking ID CR16767900) with the correct dimensions — I clearly entered 75 cm as the height.\n* When the delivery agent arrived for pickup, he flat-out **demanded extra cash** and refused to take the parcel until I paid. Super unprofessional, but I had no choice since I needed it shipped.\n* After the parcel was picked up, Porter sent me an email saying *“IMPORTANT Update on CR16767900”*. In it, they claimed the actual parcel size was different from what I declared (they twisted the numbers around). Based on this, they charged me **another ₹442.08** and threatened to hold or delay my shipment unless I paid again.\n* On top of that, **there is ZERO customer support**. No human escalation, no helpline, just automated mails that keep demanding more money.\n\nThis feels like a classic bait-and-switch. They take your booking, demand hidden charges after pickup, and leave you helpless because your parcel is already with them.\n\nIt’s frustrating that companies like this operate with no accountability. Not only is this unfair to customers, it also feels like an outright scam.\n\n**My advice:** Don’t use Porter for important shipments. They mislead, overcharge, and offer no support. Better to pay slightly more with a reliable logistics company than to risk harassment and hidden charges with Porter.\n\nHas anyone else here faced similar issues with Porter? Would love to hear if this is a one-off or a pattern.",

Came here for work , I’m a corporate finance professional and like most people, landed with the typical mix of excitement, confusion, and way too many suitcases.\n\nWhat strikes me even today is how this city feels like two different places at once: brutally fast when you’re running to catch a local to churchgate, and strangely patient when you’re sitting by Marine Drive watching the sea swallow the skyline (however recently, it has become super crowded).\n\nThe rents are ridiculous (no surprises there), the traffic tests your willpower, and somehow you’re always 15 minutes late even if you leave an hour early. But there’s also something magnetic about the chaos , the energy, the random conversations with strangers who end up feeling like old friends (i still have a love hate relationship with Mumbai street food).\n\nCurious to know for those who’ve been here longer, what keeps you rooted in this city despite everything that makes people complain about it?",

But there is a far more dangerous encroachment on that's going unpunished. It is the rich who are encroaching our roads with parking.\n\nIn the last few months, the number of people deciding that they have a right to park on the road outside their homes has increased dramatically. Look at areas in Indiranagar, New Tippasandra and Koramangala, and you'll see that most roads have become single file because people park outside their homes. Are their vehicles blocking traffic or causing inconvenience? Who cares? So what if the other half of the road is dug up? People will still park outside their homes and not shift an inch!\n\nI'm not even talking about valet parking in these areas for customers. These are cars that have been parked because there is no parking inside the premises. It's become such a menace that in some areas, we see two lines of vehicles parked on either side. I doubt even ambulances or fire engines can cross some of these roads.\n\nThere should be a special heavy penalty on people parking huge vehicles like Tata Safari, Fortuners, XUV700, Thar, Volvo and Innovas around corners. You can hardly see incoming traffic in turns. If you can spend so much money buying a car, you better have parking inside your premises. \n\nPeople will quickly make an argument about them paying taxes and having a right to this. I pay taxes as well, but I park inside my building within my alloted parking spots. I ask visitors to park in areas where they don't inconvenience others. \n\nEven worse is that after the ruckus around towing in no parking areas, the rich have been emboldened to park anywhere, and pick up quarrels with anyone who questions them. Bangalore Traffic Police seems too stretched to do anything about this. And our political leaders have grand visions about building tunnel roads and flyovers, while letting this go unpunished.\n\nIn a year or so, I foresee that we will all be crawling on all roads because of unpunished parking. Unless these guys are fined now, and heavily, this will just grow. We'll have poeple dying because ambulances and fire engines are not able to get through and children being forced to spend additional hours in school buses because their buses are slowed to a crawl. But who cares? I have money, so I have a right to the road.\n\nOn a sadistic note, we should have a rule that if you park on the roads overnight, any damage to your car is your own responsibility, and will not be covered by insurance.",

Of course dubbing has been common in other languages and I am not sure how those viewers feel but I usually watch any show/movie in its own native language which IMO is the best way to go. May not catch everything but Hey! I can learn something new.\n\nBut I am really really not happy with the quality of dubbing of some of my favorite shows. Its just garbage. Ignoring the voice acting (which doesn't work at all) the many nuances in the original, the cultural references, the subtle jokes, and sometimes the whole meaning is lost. I get it, its almost impossible to get the right translation for rhyming words for example, but if the people behind the dubbing are completely oblivious to the culture the movie is based in and the theme of it, all you will end up with is crap like Spider-man Homecoming.\n\nI didn't bother watching more than 20 mins of it before I gave up, but there is one line in that that is downright offensive and just stupid for this movie in particular. Judge for yourselves.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n(Takes place in 1st half) \n\nPeter and Ned (his healthy friend) are exercising in the school basketball court and Liz and her friends are sitting in the stands chatting about superheros.\n\nLooks like Liz has a crush on Spiderman! Oh! How well he fought four robbers stealing ATM machine!\n\n\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\n\nBoy : Ohhh... She's crushing on Spiderman..\n\nBetty : No way.. \n\nLiz: Kind of..\n\nBoy: You didn't even know how he looks like\n\nBetty: He's probably like 30.\n\nBoy: And what if his face is like all burnt?!\n\n\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe Kannada translation has one key change however\n\n\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\n\nBoy : Ohhh... She's crushing on Spiderman..\n\nBetty : No way.. \n\nLiz: Kind of..\n\nBoy: You didn't even know how he looks like\n\nBetty: He's probably like 30.\n\nBoy: AND WHAT IF HIS FACE IS ALL BLACK??!\n\n\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYes people, \"what if his face is like all burnt?\"  got translated to \"what is face is black?\". And that aired on prime TV watched by kids across the state. Apparently black/dark face is equivalent to burnt face (no offense to burnt faces) and should be avoided at all costs especially in dating.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNot only is this blatantly racist, it is just wrong on so many levels.\n\n1. First of all girls are not as obsessed as guys are with color. Works with Indians and American Blacks.\n2. The kids in movie are in the US. No one will EVER say this statement in public unless they want a flurry of black fists raining on them.\n3. The boy is telling this to Liz, played by Laura Harrier, who is black actress. WHY THE FCUK WOULD A BLACK GIRL HAVE A PROBLEM IF THE GUY IS ALSO BLACK ???\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't know man... This shows how absent minded the team behind the dubbing is about the culture in which the movie is based in. Also when the hell will Kannada industry grow out of the fair skin obsession I don't know. In fact I don't even care about the obsession... It is the blatant racism against darker skin that really pisses me off... \n\nPlease share the word about this dubbed version of movie. This is by no means healthy and hope more people can at least realize that this is a problem.",

Look it up in Google for more detail. \n\nAs, I received enthusiasm from people on the post, I went ahead and created a group for it here: https://www.downtomeet.com/beerathlon-band.\n\n\nFew people already had joined this group.\nIf this piques your interest, feel free to organize events.",

Take a deviation at the Chikkaballapur exit, and drive around the interior roads. We may or may not get down and go inside the farms as they require taking permission from the farmers. I'll try but no guarantees.\n\nThese days farmers have started growing other crops as well in place of grapes; dragon fruit, pomegranate, etc. Walking around these are not as pleasant though as there is no shade especially if it's sunny. Given there were lots of rains recently, there are other crops as well. Tomatoes, beans, bitter gourd, etc. All in all, it's a good time to drive around and see the countryside.\n\nAs of now another redditor has 80% confirmed. She will confirm for sure by Friday. So it's me and her (early 40s/late 30s); both introverts. I'll be driving a 2024 Automatic Harrier. Fully equipped with essentials.\n\nLooking for 2 more people. Preferably middle aged.\n\nDM me if interested.",

      "content": "Thread idea to Discuss/List out Flooded areas. Hello all,\n\nI have an idea to have a list of most of our areas in Bengaluru which are currently flooded due to ongoing heavy rains. This might be useful for the people to plan their travel who REALLY need to venture out for any important work.\n\nMy motivation in this matter is one of my close Aunts have come down to Bengaluru from Mumbai for her M.Sc. Nursing Final Exams. We reside in Hebbal (Dasarahalli) and she has to travel all the way to Binny Mills area (behind Majestic) for her exams at \"Nightingale Institute of Nursing\". It's a 14-15km journey and Ola-Uber may turn out to be unreliable, and may become hopeless if the rains worsen in the coming days.\n\n_My experience today:_\nTonight only we'd made a _wrong decision_ to walk to Coffee Board Layout in an Udupi Upchar eatery for dinner while it was raining. While coming back, we had to walk in the rain with our umbrella, and had to maneuver over invisible potholes. No electricity in the locality, no street lights. My spectacles had fogged up. It was extremely difficult to see. I was reliant on the flashes of Lightning ⚡ and random vehicles' headlights to see and remember where the potholes could be. It almost felt like a night-time jungle safari on hard mode! Obviously we did not get Uber-Ola and the road in front of us was getting waterlogged and gushing with rain water while only a few vehicles (1-2 vehicles per 10 minutes) waded through that water. It was difficult especially for my mother and my aunt.\n\nSo, i propose to create a thread for listing flooded areas, and how deep in the water there. We already have been issued an Orange Alert due to heavy rains in the coming days. I believe this might be helpful to a number of Bangloreans.\n\n\n_EDIT:_\n\n* If such thread already exists, please share the link in the comments.\n* Feel free to list/describe in the comments about the areas that you find waterlogged.",

It's monsoon season, but still hot - what kind of clothes/shoes I should take with me? Keep in mind, that around 30 celsius is hot summer weather for me :)\n2. Women attire at work - in Poland we don't have strickt rules, if we don't meet with clients (I don't and I won't). In summer, I wear knee-high dresses, sometimes without sleeves (not macaroni straps, just no sleeves) - will it be ok in India?\n3. Attire outside work - knee-high shorts, sleeveless shirts - will it be OK?\n4. Taxis - I'm going to land in a middle of a night at Bangalore airport, and I don't want to be ripped off :) what kind of transportation should I choose?\n5. Women safety - I'm going to Bangalore with 2 male work colleageus, from some sites I read that Bangalore is safe, from other.. not so much. I would like to hear some inside knowlege, especially from women\n6. Tipping - should I leave tips in restaurants, of for cleaning crew in a hotel? If so, how much?\n7. What to enjoy :) We have weekends off, so I want to see as much as I can :) I checked that there is a zoo in a safari style, I want to go there for sure :) .",

Was wondering if you could give me some suggestions on getting the most of these places if its too much travelling then may be I will stick to one place.\n\nFYI I have never been to any of these places before so no idea. Just I keep coming across some short videos of how the place is filled with mountains and beautiful greenery.\n\nWhat I want to do is within 2 days and here I need your advice\n- Hike a hikeable Hill which won't completely drain me.\n- Visit local monuments\n- Waterfall and Lakes or Dam\n- Amazing Roads to ride my bike\n- Affordable place to stay\n\n\nI heard there is a jungle safari I might go and try that (What are your experiences?)\n\nNote: I am doing my own research as well just that its my first time and I don't really know kannada I would love your suggestions to make the most out of these places.\n\nThank you.",

I am in process of finalizing my car and have visited all brand showrooms except the luxury ones.\n\nI can afford any car upto xuv700 but I feel car as a depreciating asset and since my usage is less (like 200km a month) and also I do not enjoy driving much. So I was looking for a compact suv in 10-12 lakh budget\n\nMy experience with showrooms has been terrible. The sales folks will not greet you properly, they will not explain you features of the car from base to top variant, they only display top variant and you don't know what kind of car you are getting.\n\nThey treat you like shit. I liked Grand Vitara and was ready to book the base variant which would cost 13.5 lakhs. The moment I told I want to book base, they started pushing me for next variant for 15.5 lakhs. When I refused, they were not respectful. As if 13.5 lakhs is not real money and the top-up 2 lakhs is the actual money!\n\nAnd never make the mistake of visiting the same showroom twice unless you are going to book on that day. \n\nA person is going to buy 13 lakh worth of car and gets no respect or proper communication. I had same experiences with Tata, Kia and Mahindra showrooms also.\n\nIs this some kind of marketing tactic or car showroom people are just too arrogant with booming sales.",

So, the moment he said that I had a few doubts and when I expressed it he said he’ll reduce the amount to 500, to which I agreed but since the payment didn’t go through  he started abusing me and using very bad derogatory words, which forced me to hang up.

Today, i booked an auto and the dirver told me he will come but when he reached the pin location he started the trip (i have no problem with that). I called him and told him where to meet me and he suddenly started shouting at me. I kept the phone and booked another auto as I was getting late. He waited outside my apartment, stopped the auto i was in, and waled up to me and tried hitting me when i defended which led to my spectacles falling, I have gotten him suspended from Rapido and have lodged a police complaint where they called him and told him to come down to the station. Even i have to go there. I'm worried that he will try to wait outside my apartment or try to do smth else. Let me know your thoughts please.",

The road is basically a subscription service — you never *own* it, you’re just renting smooth asphalt for a few days before it gets recycled.\n\nThe patchwork is so bad it looks like Minecraft in real life.

The first point of contact we managed to reach sounded half-asleep and casually mentioned that since we were “just 2 km away” . After waiting more than 20 minutes, my husband had to reach out to another POC in the escalation matrix.

All we saw were the natural trees and rocks that would be there anyway. The bonsai garden was there, but only difference between a bonsai shop was bonsais were kept at some distance between eachother. That's it. Nothing creative and everyone were going inside and coming back straight outside.\n\nWhy put up big boards making false promises and still charge an entry fee? It’s understandable if some attractions are under renovation, but then the ticket price should reflect that. Right now it feels like you’re paying for things that don’t exist.\n\nThe place doesn’t look well maintained either. The big trees are there only because they were planted decades ago. There doesn’t seem to be any proper maintenance or real upgradations. If this was the case, I would’ve preferred Cubbon Park instead.",

      "content": "I froze tonight when two men catcalled me. And then I remembered every single time I have been harassed before.. This is my first time posting on Reddit. I have always just been a reader and never commented before. After today I cannot hold it in anymore. I am exhausted and I do not have the energy to keep brushing it off.\n\nI am a 20F living in Bengaluru. Today around 7 pm I was at a small provision store near my house. I was wearing a loose trouser, a loose shirt, and a black scarf covering my hair\n\nTwo guys on a scooter passed by and catcalled me. The one sitting behind looked right at me with a big smug smile, like harassing me was some kind of achievement. I did not have the strength to shout back or react. I just stood there staring, too drained to do anything. I could not even process what disgusting words they said.\n\nIt does not matter what a woman wears. She will still be harassed.\nI was 9 years old the first time it happened. A teenage boy groped me and ran.\nI have been followed while wearing my school uniform.\nI have been followed to the bus stop while fully covered.\nI have been touched, commented on, laughed at, and made to feel unsafe more times than I can count.\n\nJust a few days ago I was getting on a bus. A boy, maybe in 11th or 12th grade, deliberately pushed himself against me. When I looked at him he moved away and laughed with his friends. His female friend asked him in Tamil, “You did it knowingly, right?” and then laughed along with him. That disgusted me even more. Seeing another woman normalize it made it worse.\n\nIt is not just strangers either. Have received unsolicited d*ck pictures from my father’s side of the family. How much are women expected to tolerate?\n\nMost of the time I fight back. I shout, glare, or try to scare them off. But there are also times like today when I just freeze. I doubt myself. I wonder if I am overreacting. But there are too many incidents now for it to be in my head.\n\nI live in Bengaluru, which is supposed to be a “safe city.” What kind of safety is this?",

      "content": "Is it common for Bengaluru police to frisk and search wallets during night checks?. I (27M) and my partner (33M) were heading back home around 2 am in an Uber from JP Nagar after our night shift when we were stopped at a police barricade on the highway.\n\nAt first, we thought it was just a routine late-night check, but it quickly became uncomfortable. The police asked my partner to step out for a full-body frisk, and when I tried to get out as well, they stopped me and instead made me open my laptop bag - every single pocket, even the hidden compartments. They even took my wallet from inside the bag and opened it without asking.\n\nThe whole thing felt invasive. I can understand routine questions or basic checks, but frisking someone head to toe and going through my wallet without permission really crossed a line for me. I stayed quiet, though the police switched to broken English with me (“where going?”). Luckily, my partner knows Kannada, which helped a bit.\n\nIs this normal in Bengaluru? What exactly are they usually looking for in such situations?",

Hi Guys,\n\nOur newly bought July 2023 Tata Safari Red Dark edition (DL10CW2155) got stolen from our home parking in Delhi this morning. The thief broke the drivers window and took the car within minutes. When we check the CCTV footage, they came in White Creta with tools and gears.\n\nI got the immobilization event 2-3 hours after my car was gone from our house. We tried all what we could do from the iRA app, but nothing worked. We called Tata customer care, but they also couldn't track the car. I'm so angry and disheartened that I spent a ton of my savings to buy the car and it got stolen in minutes. TATA iRA didn't work. What all was advertised while buying the car got shattered in minutes.\n\nLast location it showed was in Azadpur, Delhi. We went to the location, searched like anything, but we couldn't find anything. We raised the FIR then and informed the insurance company after the incident. I read the news recently that one car gets stolen in Delhi every 14 mins. I feel so unsafe right now that I question what all we pay so hefty tax for. No safety and no responsibility from public departments. Our hard earned money just got wasted for nothing.\n\nI have lost the hope in finding my car, but if anyone finds or see any trace of car, please DM.\n\nChassis Number: \\*\\*\\*631047P\\*\\*\\*\\*804\n\nNote: I would be really thankful, if any leads/help/references that any one of you have that could lead me to find the car.",

A legender Fortuner (temp number, Gurgaon) driver was driving very rash and was overtaking every single car. I was following him from Gurgoan. When he was behind me or next to me I wasn't allowing him to overtake him so probably his ego hit. And he started driving very close to me  like literally next to me if I have turned a little bit it would've definitely touched. At this point he wanted to  come in front of me and stop me. For some time I didn't allow him to overtake but no idea why I changed the fking lane and he got the chance to overtake me and he stopped in front of me. He just showed his hand nothing happened tho, he was probably thinking that I'll also confront but I didn't get out oe my car and also he didn't. \n\nif he would've get out of his I have no fking clue what I would do in that case because tbh I was scared as hell. \n\n  \n2) Now I was going back to home from Noida after meeting my friends from their society around 10pm. Their society have different exit and entry gate but at night they close the exit gate and only use entry gate for exit too. So I was about to exit the society and suddenly a Scorpio came in order to enter the society. Although he saw me still he tried to entered. bhen ka loda, Noida ki scorpio ki chodh dikha rha hai maa ka loda. Now we both were stopped as there was no space I was 90% towards the exit so ideally he had to reverse the car so that I can go. But uski shyd maa chud rhi this peeche karne mein. So we both waiting there and a taxi also waiting behind scorpio. he had the space to reverse tho. Then after some time guard came he talked to him first to reverse but he didn't, but he didn't then guard came to me I had to reverse it because I had to go to gurgaon and didn't want to get late. i swear if someone was with me at that time I wouldn't have reversed it but still Noida ke scorpio walo see panga kyu lena. \n\nWhen I exited the society I remembered police was also inside the society at that time no idea why. i thought I could've approached them maybe he was drunk. \n\n\n\nHappened to me for the first time since 3 years of driving. Fortunately his time I wasn't scared as there were many people if something were to happen.\n\n  \nLagta hai GYM jana shuru karna padega.",

      "content": "A Meetup to Remember – From Connaught Place to Mughal Gardens!. Hey everyone!\n\nAs a group, we wanted to take a moment to share something truly special—our recent Reddit meetup that started in Connaught Place and culminated in the breathtaking Mughal Garden. What began as a casual gathering of internet strangers quickly turned into an evening filled with warmth, laughter, and the kind of conversations that make you appreciate the beauty of human connections.\n\nFrom sharing a meal at McDonald's (because what's a meetup without some comfort food?) to diving into endless discussions about life, careers, aspirations, and the simple joys of everyday moments—we experienced it all. And when we finally made it to the Mughal Garden, surrounded by vibrant flowers and a sense of serenity, it felt like the perfect ending to a perfect day.\n\nMany of us came as mere usernames on a screen, unsure of what to expect, but we left with friendships that felt like they were always meant to be. Who would have thought that a platform like Reddit could lead to something as wholesome as this?\n\nIf this meetup was any indication, we’re only getting started! Here's to many more such heartwarming gatherings in the future. If you missed this one, don’t worry—there’s always a next time!\n\nUntil then, keep being awesome, Redditors! ❤️🌿✨",

Hello Delhites,\n\nThe best part of moving to Delhi was its proximity to countless tourist locations (hill stations, national park, historical places).\n\nBut honestly most of these places (like Shimla, Mussorie, Rishikesh) are over-commercialised.\n\nI am a type of guy who travels to have some peace. I travel to explore the local culture and stories.\n\nLast time I visted Nagthat, a small hill village in Uttarakhand. I stayed at a homestay that had hill views from window. The locals there took me to a waterfall that is still remains unexplored by tourists. Had lunch with locals, visited the local diety temple and saw the sunset from terrace farms. Countless memories and infinite peace.\n\nI am planning to visit another village  in Uttarakhand (Kaladhungi near Jim-Corbett National park) in last weekend of June.\n\nIf someone has similar vibes of mine and are open to explore the rural and offbeat locations, DM me. I have prepared the itinerary. I have contacts with the homestay there. So accomodations,food and guide is also sorted.\n\nWe will be having a small trek to waterfall and take a jeep safari to National park apart from enjoying some local cultural activities this time.\n\nDM me if you are interested. Even if you can’t make it this time but belong to this club, let’s stay in touch.",

Maybe if I can rent some bike/car and move towards ramgarh during the night, I can catch a beautiful sky. It's a one hour drive (around 70KM). \nDo you think this plan is safe? what precautions i should take? I don't even know if that road is working ( I just hoped on maps and saw a road joining Jaisalmer and ramgarh with low light pollution levels). \n\n Or are any there any better options that are not necessarily very expensive, please mention them. I don't mind joining a safari that can take me to a good dark star gazing spot. But i literally don't know anything about that place.\n\nHelp me out if you guys have some experience with this.",

It's just my second day on crappy roads and I am not sure how idiotic people can be\n\nPeople : \n\n1. Delhi Mumbai Expressway Speed Limit 100, and one idiot in Santro driving 30 Kmph with one hand against ear with mobile phone in the right most fast lane. No reaction to horn or whatever. \n\n2. Overtook that Santro idiot after waiting for a lotta cars to pass in order to change to middle lane. Couple Kms ahead, an imbecile in Safari rolled his window couple inches and tossed an empty can from the top of the window, (not the bottom end of the window but top ; gosh) on the neat and clean expressway at a speed of 90. Missed my windshield by inches. \n\n3. Lots of idiots don't check the road before merging on it. They feel it's their right to merge and the people travelling at 80kmph on the road will brake to 0 for them. Nearly missed a lotta vehicles. Even in city people don't look back, they just merge.\n\n4. High beam menace, people just don't know when to turn it off. I keep on signalling to turn it off but they continue to keep driving at high beam. \nSome idiots are driving on the wrong side with the high beam on. God have mercy some idiots are parked with the high beam on. \nOn top of that some have custom modified high lumen lights just to blind others and keep it all tome high.\n\n5. Some idiots are driving with hazards lights on.\n\n6. ROADS : Roads here sucks, some expressways are good with heavy tolls. But most roads lacks the strips, reflectors, signs and marks, speed breaker signs and indicators, and speed breakers are the worst design ever. \n\nJust ranting.",

Jawai is famous for its leopard sightings, granite hills, and peaceful wilderness – but not many people know the practical details of planning a trip here.\n\nSince I host guests regularly, I get asked these questions a lot:\n\t•\tWhat’s the best time to visit Jawai for leopard spotting?\n\t•\tIs 2-3 days enough for Jawai, or should you stay longer?\n\t•\tHow does a Jawai safari work – morning vs evening drives?\n\t•\tAre there both luxury camps and budget stays in Jawai?\n\t•\tHow far is Jawai from Udaipur, Jodhpur, or Jaipur?\n\t•\tIs Jawai a good place for wildlife photography compared to Ranthambore?\n\t•\tWhat are some offbeat experiences in Jawai apart from safaris?\n\nIf you’re planning a trip, feel free to drop your questions here – I’ll be happy to share honest insights from a local host’s perspective.",

      "content": "For someone who need a small city car to drive around Delhi..  \n\nHello lovely people ,I checked out the MG comet at the showroom in Safdarjung ,here are my observations! Spent an hour on it :)\n\n**I have divided this post into Headings and small paragraphs so if you dont like long reads just** ***ctrl+f*** **and find the para concerning you :)**\n\n# How many variants will be offered?\n\nAs of today the sales exec assured us that **variant that has been shown in media drives** is the one that costs 7.98 Lakhs (introductory prices).Mg plans to introduce base variants, which will be devoid of features like request sensors, led lights and a **Barebones variant** may also be introduced later as they target achieving 60% localization by the end of this year.\n\n# Which car do we mainly drive?\n\nA 2014 Honda City ,needed to clarify this as whenever I mention terms like comfort ,airiness all are in comparision to being in the rear seat of a city for **9 years now** XD\n\n# How was the interior space?\n\nRear Legroom - I am 5 '11, so for me with the driver seat adjusted to my driving position, it was more than enough, could easily sit behind for 1-2 hours without feeling cramped. The rear window has been excellently planned, it does not feel small at all, it doesn't open but it fulfills its job of providing a feeling of roominess and airiness in the rear seat.\n\nThe front - The benefit of this car being a Born electric vehicle is that the front had a **LOT of space**, like you could bring the co-passenger seat to the max front sliding setting and still have a bit of knee-room left.\n\nThe Boot - Non-Existent, only enough to fit 2-3 laptop bags. How many times do you use the boot while picking up children from school, buying groceries and other daily stuff ,*that's something you should think about if you think less boot space is a problem.*\n\nThe rear seats fold down in a 50-50 format to create a huge flat space.\n\nHow does the exterior look in person?\n\nThe cars looks beautiful and modern in white, green was too tacky for my taste, the LED treatment all around looks beautiful.\n\nThe car has a **different or weird shape** but this is the exact case of what happened with the **Verna** ,in person the Comet and the Verna both look a lot better than what they do online.\n\n# Ground Clearence?\n\nIt looked way less online than in real life, the sales exec told us its \\*\\*150mm,\\*\\*we didnt hit any major potholes during our test drive and the car seemed to go over speed breakers pretty well, even for someone with major back issues the ride felt comfortable.\n\n# Drive review?\n\nVery silent, the whining of the motor as the car speeds up feels futuristic, might annoy someone Aswell, the inside insulation was good, the car starts feeling unstable after 80-85 kmph, maybe because of the weird shape, but its very difficult to hit 80-85 in Delhi-NCR XD\n\n# Build Quality and Interior feel?\n\nIt feels very solidly built from the outside ,the doors are pretty heavy and flex on panels are nil ,the interior quality is top notch ,lots of premium materials are used ,so no complaints in both aspects\n\n# Why such a negative outcry online?\n\nMe being a culprit of it aswel\\*\\*l,\\*\\*this is all over the Verna again, checking out the car in real life made me change my opinions to a great extent ,I suggest you guys do Aswell.\n\n# Comparisions with Tiago ev?\n\nTiago ev and Comet ev are both different cars but fall in the same segment, this is exactly the case with **Virtus vs Honda Cit**y both are sedans, equally priced, same segment but **both cater to a very different type of buyer**\n\nTiago ev is for a buyer who absolutely needs boot space when there are 4 people in the car and needs to take the car on highway runs, I do not count 4 doors as an advantage because the comet has ample space in the rear seat, If you have elders in your family who will face problem in climbing onto the rear seats then eyes closed go for the tiago ev but feel free to disagree .\n\nComet ev is for a buyer who wants a premium interior, a different car, needs a city beater and does not need boot space with 4 people onboard while driving in the city, even if there are 3 people the boot space with one seat down is ample\n\nThe Comet offers 170kms-190kms real world range which is equivalent or a bit more than the Tiago medium range variants ,the long range versions command a premium of 2,43,000\n\nI am attaching a link of a photo which compares Tiago ev and the Comet side by side it should give you a clear picture [Mg comet vs Tiago ev comparision](https://ibb.co/c30JjPv)\n\n# Bhai in 70,000 more I get the Tiago ev with 4 doors and a proper car ?\n\nI am attaching a link of a youtube video of the base model tiago ev which is the most talked about when mentioning the Comet ev **if you are happy with what is offered then yes you should pay 70,000 more and get it** [Tata Tiago EV XE \\*BASE MODEL\\* walkaround](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ps5SIDGYDU)\n\nPlastic door handles, no central locking, steel wheels, manual windows all these things take me back to when we owned a Santro Xing ,that too after paying 7 Lakhs plus in 2023 ,so for me its a no,but if you absolutely despise the design of the comet, need 4 doors and boot space then its the best option.\n\n# Why didnt MG price the Comet 6-7 Lakh ,they would have got a lot more takers ?\n\nHonestly I cant answer this question in its entirety ,but the sales exec told us the battery pack alone costs 4,20,000 - 4,50,000 so yes offering such a huge touchscreen, solid build, excellent interiors, The Tiago ev and the market definitely pressured them to give a starting price of 7.8 Lakhs ,without a competitor it surely would have been priced at 10 lakhs-11 lakhs.\n\nThe sales exec also said to us that 2 more base models are in the pipeline ,but he was not verY sure of the timeline.\n\n# Comparision with Nano/Nano EV?\n\nNano was a very different product with a totally different goal,even the Neo Nano electric evs which exist today have very average interiors,with poor performance along with terrible safety . I dont think Tata would invest to make the Nano Ev again,as to comply with today's safety standards they would have to rework the platform and the structure which will increase its price too much. For memes and jokes yes Comet looks like a modern Nano XD\n\n# Major misses by the Comet EV?\n\n**Lack of fast charging is a big miss for sure** ,if you know you will travel around a 100 kms a day or 150 Km at max then that wont be a problem but sometimes if you need to go further then the charging times are way too long,this makes it strictly a city car.\n\nThe design and lack of 4 doors will always create a negative perception amongst Indian buyers ,but a visit to the showroom might change it.\n\nPlease add more ,these are the ones I can think of on top of my head.\n\n# Attention by other people?\n\nThis car gets a **LOT of attention** on roads *(in a positive way)* happened to us for the first time that *multiple people had us roll down our windows and asking the price, they were quite impressed by the size and footprint of the vehicle.*\n\n# FINAL VERDICT?\n\nI made a very interesting observation during the test drive as we had stopped on a red light ,in a city car you interact with the interior of the car more, so for me primarily a city car should have a good interior while the Mg comet excelles at it the lower Tiago variants are just not that good ,the top variants command too much of a premium which makes the breakthrough time longer ,I think the Comet for what it offers is an absolute steal at the current price",

A consistent pattern I've observed on the roads and highways is that, if you overtake any car with a flag/sword on the bonnet they make it their life's mission to overtake you back.

I frequently ride the Chennai-Coimbatore stretch and such activities help remove some monotony from the ride.\n\nIt's a given that they'll overtake you, and then get stuck either in tolls or behind trucks/buses. So the cycle keeps going on. And the good thing is that you don't even have to ride rash or fluctuate your speed. Just a consistent speed of 90-100 is enough, and safe riding practices actually help replenish the cycle.\n\nJust a fun observation from our city/state.",

      "content": "Why do Chennai auto drivers (uber and normal) overcharge when public transport is so good?. I landed at Chennai International Airport today. From the airport, I just wanted to go to a nearby restaurant about 2 km away. I booked an Uber auto, and the fare shown was ₹95. The driver who accepted (ironically named Anbarasan) asked me for ₹200 instead. When I refused, he told me, “ride cancel pannu da punda.” I cancelled the ride happily, walked a bit, and took the next bus to the restaurant.\n\nFrom there, I had to go about 30 km to reach my hotel. I checked and found out that Chennai has bus services almost everywhere, so I took connecting buses and reached near my hotel without any trouble. From that spot, I just needed to travel another 1.5 km. A local auto driver again asked for ₹200. Instead, I waited a few minutes, got on another bus, and the driver was kind enough to stop right in front of my hotel. Total expense was about 60 rupees. If I booked uber, it would've costed me at least 1200 rupees.\n\nI’m from Kerala, and I’ve used Uber autos many times there in kochi. I’ve never faced this kind of issue. Maybe there are isolated cases that I am not aware of, but its nothing like what I experienced here.\n\nMy genuine question to people in Chennai, How did things get to this point? Why is this kind of behavior considered normal? Especially when you have such solid public transport options such as metro, buses, trains, etc. why do people still give in to these tactics?",

AC EMU prices should be slashed more than 50%.\n\nSlashing prices of AC EMU will increase usage of AC trains, thereby helping to replace existing ones with AC services, and reducing footboard travel. Current prices seem deliberately kept high so that only few people use it, similar to first class. But if they slash AC prices and replace existing ones with AC, it will increase their overall revenue and reduce losses, thereby provide better passenger amenities.",

      "content": "Got kicked out of a public place for sitting with my partner (?). so I'm 20F and I was sitting with my partner in this relatively quiet place a bit closer to where I live, which is actually a defense area. There's never been any norm of any kind, that you shouldn't sit in these public parks or bus stands just because it is a defense area, and I know so because I'd been living here for almost a decade. I was chatting with my partner about our day after his work and it was about afternoon, two policemen on bike crossed us. We did look at them then and they carried on. However 5 minutes later they came around, asking us what business we had in that place. Since my partner wasn't exactly from here I answered saying my house is around here, literally a kilometre away. The police man was a bit adamant, \"inga naa, enga?\" (Where, from around here?) and I named the area I'm from, and asked him if he has any problem. He said \"idhu family vara area, defense place idhu\" and I asked him again \"yes, is there a problem?\" and he kept asking me what purpose I'm here for. I told him my house is like 1 kms away, I usually go home by this way. He insisted that the gate on the way to my area isn't open today (which I already know) and I amswered \"yes I saw. I'll be using the other route.\" And he just glared at me for a bit before another police man in another bike dropped by what our business is. And this policeman assured \"no, they'll be leaving now.\" I'm like, fucking hell, tell me what I'm doing wrong man. And we just left, both of us had our own scooters, and my partner left for his home as well by taking another cut. Apparently, the policeman who dropped by later followed us for a kilometre or so before turning, as he observed.\n\nI couldn't exactly understand why this happened. I'd like to think the reason is not as lame as \"this is a family area, you guys are a couple\" (I was literally just sitting, with a good distance from him anyway) but is there any rule for merely stepping on these stringent defense areas? I use this road every single day, hell my father was a defense person that's the reason why I'm even in this city. I don't know if I should also consider that since it's Vijaya Dhasami or something so they're on patrol, ila veembu ku dhan pannangla enna. Regardless I'm just baffled, like wow.",

      "content": "Should Chennai invest more in proper footpaths and cycle-friendly pathways?. I’ve been away from Chennai for about 5 years now, but one thing I always wonder is whether the city is seriously considering better pedestrian and cycling infrastructure. With the rapid expansion of the metro and other public transport systems, shouldn’t the government also focus on safe, well-planned walking pathways that connect main roads to inner streets?\n\nBack when I lived on OMR, I noticed the so called “service roads” had a lot of potential. If redesigned, they could become dedicated pedestrian/cyclist lanes, instead of being clogged with random vehicles. It feels like a step that could make “Greater Chennai” truly greater.\n\nTypically this needs to be cascadded to other districts as well!",

      "content": "Could this strategy work out for TVK. So I was just thinking that if Vijay doesn't form coalition and DMK returns to power he's basically done for. He needs to form a coalition with ADMK but they're already with BJP who he said was their ideological rival. Can they adopt a strategy like this? Note: formatted and summarised by chatgpt\n🚀 Pitch to Vijay: The Smart Coalition-without-BJP Strategy\n\n🎯 The Goal\n\t•\tDefeat DMK in 2026\n\t•\tKeep your independent, clean image intact (no direct tie with BJP)\n\t•\tBuild TVK as a serious political force\n\t•\tSecure real bargaining power inside a post-DMK government\n\n⸻\n\n🔑 The Strategy\n\n1. ADMK Strongholds (154 seats)\n\t•\tYou do not contest.\n\t•\tUrge your supporters to back ADMK.\n\t•\tAt least half your base (≈11–12%) moves to ADMK.\n\t•\tOutcome: ADMK vote share in these seats swells to ~62%.\n\t•\t✅ DMK is locked out in these seats.\n\n⸻\n\n2. Non-ADMK Constituencies (80 seats)\n\t•\tYou directly contest these seats (where BJP is the main NDA face).\n\t•\tBJP is weak (≈8%), you have ~23% potential.\n\t•\tDMK holds ~45% — but you emerge as the primary challenger in these areas.\n\t•\t✅ TVK becomes the face of opposition in 1/3rd of Tamil Nadu.\n\n⸻\n\n3. The Deal with ADMK\n\t•\tStrike a formal understanding:\n“We will strengthen ADMK in its seats by not contesting. In return, in the 80 seats where ADMK does not compete, if TVK wins more seats or even outperforms BJP in vote share, then ADMK must support Vijay as Deputy Chief Minister in a joint government.”\n\t•\tWhy this works:\n\t•\tFor ADMK: They get DMK pushed back in their strongholds without splitting votes.\n\t•\tFor TVK: A clear pathway to government office, without bending to BJP.\n\t•\tFor the people: A united front against DMK, without the baggage of a BJP tie-up.\n\n⸻\n\n📊 The Numbers\n\t•\tStatewide averages:\n\t•\tDMK ~45%\n\t•\tCombined Anti-DMK (ADMK+BJP+TVK) ~52%\n\t•\tADMK strongholds (154 seats):\n\t•\tAnti-DMK consolidation ~62% vs DMK ~45%\n\t•\t✅ Safe for ADMK\n\t•\t80 TVK battle seats:\n\t•\tTVK ~23%, BJP ~8%, DMK ~45%\n\t•\t❌ Tough but this is where TVK can grow and show its strength\n\t•\tEven if you don’t sweep, outperforming BJP here gives you leverage\n\n⸻\n\n🏆 Why This Works for You\n\t•\t✅ Avoids BJP stigma: No alliance, no handshake, but no vote-splitting disaster either.\n\t•\t✅ Elevates TVK: You’re not “just helping ADMK” — you’re carving out your own zone of influence.\n\t•\t✅ Deputy CM Guarantee: A built-in reward for proving your strength. You don’t just campaign — you negotiate power.\n\t•\t✅ Public Narrative: You are the responsible leader who avoided splitting the anti-DMK vote, while refusing BJP’s shadow.\n\n⸻\n\n🚨 Risks & Challenges\n\t•\tIn the 80 seats, DMK still starts ahead. You need strong campaigning to consolidate anti-DMK voters behind TVK (instead of BJP).\n\t•\tADMK might hesitate to concede the Deputy CM clause — but with numbers on your side, you can force that negotiation.\n\n⸻\n\n🌟 The Pitch Line\n\n“Thalapathy, you don’t need BJP to beat DMK.\nLeave ADMK their bastions and strengthen them.\nClaim your 80-seat battlefield as your own.\nAnd if you prove stronger than BJP there — Tamil Nadu will see you as Deputy Chief Minister in 2026.”\n\n⸻",

      "content": "Almost no one questioning DMK govt trying to monopolize narratives here. They arrested Felix, who was basically asking questions, and here we have people trying to play devil’s advocate for DMK(Cont). Have you questioned Anbil Mahesh acting before dead bodies?(especially him making sure his words “Condition ah follow pannunga da “ is captured in the recorder/phone mic)Isn’t that more morally bankrupt than whatever Vijay did with his video now?\n\nThis country is down the shitter — BJP in center propaganda and DMK in State propaganda.\n\nYou’re all saying Vijay, Felix are inciting violence by fomenting conspiracy theories, but what about the central govt team member who said they are gonna investigate the claims that there were stabbing and slashing victims among the crowd? They have asked for a Supreme Court judge-headed panel to investigate it.\n\nIt is easy to say BJP-led panel will deflect blame on DMK. But what will DMK-led panel do? Accept their part of the blame like harichandrans? Don’t be fucking naive!\n\nLet multiple authorities or anyone who can investigate claims. We, as people, should gather insights from all of them and get the neutral position from there.\n\nThis scoundrel udai, before heading back to Dubai, has the audacity to shepherd the press towards asking why Vijay was late, like it was the only cause. His dad ran away from the press conference when asked about govt security lapse, which we all can deduce as a bigger and more significant root cause than Vijay arriving late.\n\nAlso, where is everyone not asking why so many had their bodies post mortem (PM) done so quickly while the protocol is not to do PM after the day ended? Was PM done so that Stalin can do a photo op with the dead bodies during his visit? Or as some people claim, were they done quickly to hide other details?\n\nThe MP from the central committee raised a valid question: why was the majority of eventually dead or dead-on-arrival patients brought to the govt hospital 25kms away from the incident, rather than the private ones closer to the incident? Surely in times of crisis private hospitals can’t say no to at least administer life-saving measures before releasing them to GH, right? Especially jarring to think that Senthil balajee proudly announced that they will take care of expenses of private care patients.\n\nAlso, who is going to ask about the empty ambulances that were going through the crowd to disrupt? (This was a DMK tactic which was done in all previous TVK and ADMK meetings). Understand this people: these ambulances are not the ones carrying the sick people, they are empty ones coming through the venue to disrupt whomever the opposition leader is that is speaking.\n\nIf Vijay arriving late is cited as root cause, shouldn’t this blatant empty ambulance dirty tactic actually have caused thallu mullu? Which is also a factor for stampede ?\n\nLathi Charge is a typical Indian police crowd control but tactical application lathi charge is to incite panic is also another cause mentioned and there are videos of it happening admist the crowd.  \n\nVaazga Tamilnadu.",

She didn't know which location to put the pin and randomly put it elsewhere. Thankfully it was on the way.\n\nAvalathanga, first half over. Had banana and bread 😋 Some moong dal and eggs. Hydrate yourself and fire away the questions. I'll answer them at night.\n\n***Your Friendly Neighborhood Auto-Man***",

      "content": "Women of chennai - Do you use bike taxi?. I want to ask this question to women in Chennai- do you all use bike taxi? \n\nOffline I have started to use bike taxi - one because it's cheap and two I love the bike ride and alas, this is the only way I can take a ride in bikes. \n\nIdk people instantly judge whenever I tell them I take bike taxis. Idk maybe the uncomfortable fact that I would be pillion rider with an unknown man..? Nvm I can clearly see the judgment and hence I started getting off right before my colony arrives. \n\nI have to address the safety part - Ngl this was one of my biggest concerns too and I'm very glad to say - Rapido so far for me had been the safest ever. There is not even one ride where I felt unsafe. \n\nAnd I'm very happy how this has turned out for me. Absolutely safe + affordable + breezy bike rides.\n\nI had taken bike taxis at noon, late night, evening - although I would be slightly skeptical before getting in the bike, but 10mins on to the ride I stop even tracking and can actually relax. \n\nOfcourse I will not say, rapido rides are most comfortable - it highly depends on the bike and the amount of space the rider takes. Although many had been uncomfortable with that, but none had been \"unsafe\" \n\nI want to know the experiences of fellow women in Chennai who actively uses bike taxis. Tell me about your comfort, safety, happy/unfortunate tales, the judgements you get from people.. I'm all ears.\n\n5 star to all my rapido drivers, I can't thank you enough.",

[https://www.manufacturingtodayindia.com/agnikul-cosmos-reveals-plans](https://www.manufacturingtodayindia.com/agnikul-cosmos-reveals-plans)\n\n•At the International Astronautical Congress (IAC) 2025, Agnikul revealed a roadmap toward a rocket system in which no part is discarded or expended, i.e., full reusability.    \n•They are leveraging patents across India, Europe, and the U.S. that cover multi-purpose systems, recovery, and reusability technologies.    \n•A key technical twist is their focus on a combined launch-vehicle + satellite system, and using semi-cryogenic propellant technology, which they say will help with refurbishment and re-flight operations.    \n•They have already demonstrated elements needed for reusability: their controlled ascent test (for trajectory, avionics, autopilot) is one milestone they cite.    \n•Their additive manufacturing / 3D printing facility in Chennai is part of the plan to reduce production cost, improve flexibility, and support reusability. They claim up to \\~50 % cost reductions in rocket production.    \n•Their existing launch vehicle under development is Agnibaan, a modular small-satellite launcher.    \n•As a stepping stone, Agnikul already flew a suborbital demonstrator called Agnibaan SOrTeD (Sounding/Rapid Test Demonstrator), which successfully flew in May 2024 to \\~20 km altitude, thereby validating their engine, control, and trajectory systems.    \n•The first full orbital version of Agnibaan is still under development, and the reusability enhancements would come in future variants.[](https://x.com/CataPaul2/status/1972626639734428043)",

Let’s say I have a budget of around ₹25,000 per month, and I don’t care about saving anything – I just want to spend the whole amount on rent, food, travel, utilities, and other day-to-day needs.\n\nI’m not expecting luxury, but I do want to know if this is enough to survive and live slightly comfortably in Chennai. By “comfortable,” I mean not having to constantly cut corners for food, transportation, or basic lifestyle stuff.\n\nSo, would ₹25k/month be realistic for that in Chennai? Or would it still feel like a struggle?\n\nWould love to hear from people actually living there – what’s your monthly breakdown like, and do you think 25k is manageable?\n\nThanks in advance!",

Sadly, in today’s digital world, what often follows is not solidarity but division, conspiracy theories, and blame games. Instead of focusing on healing, many individuals use such moments for attention, outrage, or political mileage.\n\n# The Disturbing Trend Online\n\n1. Keyboard Warriors – People who contribute nothing meaningful but attack others, spread unverified claims, or make everything about their agenda.\n2. Conspiracy Lovers – Instead of facts, they thrive on rumors. Their “theories” do nothing but insult victims and derail genuine conversations.\n3. Insensitive Commentary – Some even mock or minimize the suffering, forgetting that behind every headline are grieving families and shattered lives.\n4. Attention Seekers – A tragedy becomes an excuse for social media posts, hashtags, and performative outrage, while real support is nowhere to be seen.\n\nThis behavior is not just shameful—it actively harms victims and their families by drowning out authentic support.\n\n# Why Digital ID Matters\n\nA trusted Digital ID system can help restore order and accountability in such situations:\n\n* Authenticity of Voice: Verified identities ensure real people are speaking—not bots, trolls, or fake profiles.\n* Accountability: Those who misuse tragedies for hate, misinformation, or harassment can be held responsible.\n* Elevating Truth: Platforms can prioritize verified voices and official updates, making it harder for conspiracy theories to dominate.\n\nTragedies reveal not just the fragility of life but also the character of society. The fact that some people choose to spread lies, take sides, or mock victims instead of showing compassion is a stain on digital culture.",

      "content": "Shops in Ritchie Street which repairs Home Theaters ?. I have a Sony 5.1 home theater system (HBD-DZ350, 1000W) that I bought years ago. Unfortunately, it doesn’t turn on anymore due to a power supply issue.\n\nI checked with the Sony service center, and they quoted ₹7.5k for repairs. A third-party shop in Anna Nagar quoted around ₹6.5k. Honestly, that feels too high since I originally bought the system for ₹20k. I don’t want to spend almost half the cost just on servicing.\n\nDoes anyone know if there are reliable shops in Ritchie Street that can fix this for a more reasonable price ? I don’t really know any shops there.\n\nI genuinely love this system and have enjoyed using it for OTT content. Sadly, I don’t see similar systems in the market these days. If I end up having to scrap it, the speakers are still in good condition. Does anyone know what I can do with them ? Like repurposing or connecting them to another setup?\n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated.",

      "content": "Petty Revenge on Auto Driver. So usually I book autos on early mornings to take my dad to hospital for dialysis and it was no different today as well. We booked an auto via Namma Yatri. The driver called asking how much does the ride cost and it was 178. He asked for a round off around 200. Usually the ride costs 150 and since we were booking early yatri added another 30 as well and he said that he won't get any return ride from the hospital which is a blatant lie but it was already getting late for us so I agreed to give 200. \n\nWhen he reached, we asked him to pull a little forward near the pavement so it would make it easier for my dad to board (which should be common sense since my dad was visibly weak and had bondage since he had a broken leg) which he didn't but okay fine. \n\nWe boarded and on the way my dad asked whether we can have any tea in any tea shop on the way. Most auto drivers stop by and we get them a complimentary tea as well and some do say that they can't stop midway. Those drivers usually didn't ask us any extra cash. He said he can't stop because he'll need to take next ride for passenger.\n\nIn my mind I already fixed that I'm not gonna pay him extra 20 since he didn't stop for any tea and he said himself he has got his next ride from the drop off point. But what triggered me was two things which happened before we reach our destination.\n\n1. He was speeding through the bad roads we already have and my dad was visibly in pain till we reach the hospital.\n2. When we reached, he asked which entry would you like to drop on and I said near the emergency ward but he took a wrong turn. Myself and my dad were telling that he took a wrong turn but he had earphones on and he misunderstood what we said and stopped near the main entrance which is few metres away from the emergency ward and it would be too much of a hazzle to move my dad. Now he started shouting that we gave the wrong direction but that asshole was putting earphones and was not listening for what we were trying to say.\n\nAnd when I pointed out that him wearing earphones and not listening he just drove mad to the E.Ward and I got my dad down first and sent him ahead on a wheelchair into the hospital and I paid him 180 and went into the hospital straight without saying anything. Noticing I didn't paid him the extra 20 he started shouting and I just went ahead. Security from hospital cleared him out since he was making a fuss.\n\nI gave a bad rating in Namma Yatri and officially raised a complaint as well. Fuck these guys.",

      "content": "There's a Pushpa on the road!. **Kasa kai Pune?** It’s me again. Your friendly, emotionally bankrupt Punekar reporting live from the urban safari that is my daily commute.\n\nToday, I had the honor of encountering our city’s most majestic species: **Pushpas on the road.**\n\nYou know them.\n\nTwo-wheeler riders with the phone wedged between their shoulder and ear.  \nOne hand on the accelerator, one hand on destiny, and a neck angle that would make chiropractors retire..\n\n**Flower. Not fire.**\n\nSaw two accidents today, the first accident starred a **Pushpa on a Bullet**—no mirrors, no brain cells, and a neck angle that would impress yoga teachers. He was gliding along with his phone tucked flower-style, moving slower than a sugarcane tractor on paternity leave. Then a car behind him honked. That was it. Pushpa got triggered. \n\n**“Rukhega nai saala!”**\n\nHe panicked, twisted the throttle like he was escaping the law of physics, and **bang!** Straight into the car in front. The impact was so poetic, even the potholes paused to watch.  \n  \nHe gets down, dusts himself off, and instead of apologizing, turns to the car behind him and yells:  \n**“Kai ghai aahe tujhi?!”**\n\nSir WHAT?!?!?… YOU were on the phone. YOU crashed. But sure, let’s blame the person who honked because you were holding a traffic conference call on a scooter and moving slower than a sugarcane tractor on strike. (Btw, is it just me or are we seeing a lot of tractors on the road, in the past couple of weeks?)\n\nThe second accident was at **Mundhwa Chowk,** which I call **the armpit of Pune.** The traffic is so humid and sticky, it feels like the city is trying to marinate you in your own sweat.\n\nHere, another Pushpa bloomed. Wrong-side overtaking, speed breaker as launchpad, phone still flower-style like he was hosting **Pushpa FM 101.1: Live from the ICU.**\n\nPhysics, like Pune Police, did not care.  \n  \nHe went airborne, landed mid-road, and two random guys helped him up. He casually brushed the dust off, restarted the bike, and rode away like this was his **daily cardio.** In Mundhwa, that’s not an “accident”—it’s just **another petal on the asphalt.**\n\nI swear, Pune’s roads have become **Pushpa Gardens**—full of two-wheeler flowers blooming in chaos.  \n**Flower today. Bouquet at your funeral tomorrow.**",

Me and my wife wanted to celebrate that by traveling some place. So we are looking for suggestions where we could travel to from Pune while considering below things:\n\n1. We got a car and plan to travel via car only as it'll be more flexible,  easy and more manageable for my daughter and wife. So distance can't be more than 8-9hrs away.\n\n2. We don't want to have a party etc, just want a peaceful trip where 3 of us could relax amd enjoy this occasion.\n\n3. We are open to anything, temples, beaches, mountains(trekking is also fine), jungle safari, camping.\n\n4. Plan to keep it to a 2 day trip but can extend or shorten the trip if needed.\n\nAll suggestions are welcome. Thanks.",

      "content": "Friend Turned Scammer: The ₹3.8 Lakh Digital Business Trap I Almost Fell For. Hey guys, this is a long story 😅 I’m sharing all the details so you can see exactly what happened. Don’t worry, I’ve added a clear summary at the end—at least read that part!\n\nOne day, while I was busy with my work, I suddenly received a call from an unknown number. When I answered, it turned out to be a friend (let his name be ABC). I had only spoken to him during my first year of college (now I am in 4th year). At first, the conversation was casual—we exchanged the usual “how are you” and “what are you doing” type of small talk. But after a while, he suddenly told me that he was doing some kind of business. Out of curiosity, I asked what business, and he said it was something related to “digital distribution of luxury products.” He added that if we could meet in person, he would explain everything in detail.\n\nA couple of days later, I called ABC back and agreed to meet. He told me to come to Bakelore bakery in Madhapur, high-class area of Hyderabad. When we met, the interaction felt strange right from the start. Instead of explaining his business directly, he began by “testing” my so-called business mentality. He asked me questions like, “What is the difference between a small businessman and a big businessman?” I gave him my answers, which seemed to satisfy him. After this, he told me he would discuss with his “senior business partners” and let me know whether I was “eligible” to join the business or not.\n\nAfter two or three days, ABC called me again. He told me that his “senior partners” had agreed that I could become part of the business. He also said that the seniors wanted to meet me personally to “test my mentality.” A date and time were fixed, and he asked me to come to a PAUL nexity café near Durgam Cheruvu.\n\nWhen I reached, ABC first told me to wait at a high-end coffee shop nearby. After a while, he called me to the actual location. I joined him there, and soon a woman—introduced herself as a senior business partner—came and spoke to me. She was polite, well-spoken, and used advanced English while asking me questions about my “business mentality.” I gave my answers, and she acted as if she was impressed. But honestly, it felt a little staged, like she was pretending to be impressed just to win me over.\n\nAfter she left, another person—this time a male senior partner—came in. He also asked me a few questions, and we had around 10–15 minutes of casual conversation. Then, before leaving, he dropped the real bombshell: he said that joining this business required an investment of ₹3.8 lakhs, and not even for the actual business, but purely for “licensing.” According to him, since this was about digital distribution of luxury products (international brands like Gucci, Louis Vuitton, etc.), international licensing was compulsory, and that’s what the 3.8 lakhs would cover.\n\nDuring all this, the senior partners had also mentioned something even more concerning. They told me that after my initial meetings, there would be a mandatory six-hour session that I would have to attend. But here’s the shocking part: they said I must come to that meeting with ₹3.8 lakhs ready in my account.\n\nAnd not just any regular account—they specifically told me not to keep it in a normal bank account. Instead, they insisted I deposit the money into something they called “Global Niyo Bank.” That immediately struck me as strange, because if this was a legitimate business, why would they want the money parked in some unfamiliar place rather than a trusted bank?\n\nAfter telling me about the ₹3.8 lakhs, the senior partner added another detail—that my friend ABC himself had already paid almost ₹9 lakhs for this licensing and some kind of “stakes.” That statement shocked me a bit. Later, when I asked my friend ABC directly about it, he was visibly uncomfortable. At first, ABC hesitated, stopping mid-sentence and struggling to explain, but eventually ABC admitted that yes, he had paid ₹9 lakhs into this so-called business.\n\nThat was the exact point when I started to feel real doubt. The way ABC spoke—pausing, stuttering, avoiding eye contact—felt very unnatural, almost like he was forced to stick to a script but couldn’t deliver it smoothly. Something about the whole situation just didn’t add up.\n\nAfter I came home, I kept thinking about everything. Despite my doubts, a part of me was still curious, so I decided I should understand the business fully before making any judgment. I called my friend ABC and told him that I wanted him to personally explain everything in detail, because the so-called senior partners hadn’t actually given me a clear picture of how the business worked. He agreed, and we planned to meet the next day.\n\nThe next day, we met at McDonald’s near Cyber Towers in Hitech City. To my surprise, my friend ABC came to pick me up in his Tata Harrier car and was unusually polite. At McDonald’s, we had lunch together, and again, to my surprise, he insisted on paying the entire bill himself.\n\nAfterwards, we moved to the nearby Starbucks, where ABC said he would explain everything to me in detail. But before he even started, something strange happened—he suddenly took a photo of me without asking. When I questioned him, he casually said he wanted to send it to another friend who had asked if he was hanging out with his girlfriend. I told him to send it on “view once” mode, but he brushed it off, saying he forgot. I tried to let it go, but deep down I felt uneasy. Something about the whole thing didn’t sit right with me.\n\nMy friend ABC also told me that in order to attend the mandatory six-hour meeting, I had to book a slot in advance. That’s why he insisted on my Aadhar card and PAN card details—according to him, it was “compulsory” to confirm my spot for that 6 hours meeting. Feeling pressured, I reluctantly sent the details to him through WhatsApp so that my slot could be booked.\n\nThat night, after coming home, I explained the entire situation to my parents. My father, concerned and cautious, said he wanted to meet my friend and the so-called senior partners to understand the business himself. I called my friend ABC and told him this. Shortly after, my friend ABC called back and scheduled a date and time for my father to meet the senior partners.\n\nTo my surprise, the initial location was set at Tolichowki, which is only about 10 km from my place. But at the last moment, they changed the location to Miyapur, which is roughly 23 km away. Without much choice, my father and I had to ride our bike all the way there.\n\nWe finally reached a Starbucks in Miyapur, where my father met my friend ABC and the senior partners. During the meeting, my father asked them directly whether the business was genuine or a scam. The senior partners confidently assured him that it was completely legitimate and that every single transaction would be properly recorded.\n\nAfter leaving Starbucks, I asked my father for his opinion. He told me that he suspected this was a scam. He explained that, based on his instincts and the way everything had been handled, he felt this could be a potential fraud. He advised me not to go forward with the business. He also said that if I really wanted to pursue it, I could, but he strongly believed it was a scam.\n\nAfter coming home and thinking a lot, I decided to call my friend ABC. I asked him to show proof of the 9 lakhs transaction, since the senior partners had claimed that he had already paid this amount. From that point on, my friend started acting very strangely. He repeatedly asked me whether I believed him or not—over and over again—and gave me excuses like he had to leave for his village at 5 a.m. the next morning.\n\nDespite all this drama, I started noticing inconsistencies. That night, I stayed awake until 2 a.m., but to my surprise, my friend was online on WhatsApp until 2 a.m., even though he claimed he needed to leave at 5 a.m. This behavior made me increasingly suspicious.\n\nThen came the final confirmation: when I asked for the transaction proof, he set another condition—he said I had to show ₹3.8 lakhs in my own account first, only then would he show his bank statement. At that moment, everything clicked. The pressure tactics, the excuses, the personal data request, and now this ridiculous demand confirmed 100% that this was a scam.\n\nThe next morning, I called my friend ABC and told him straight up that I was not interested and was dropping out of this so-called business. He tried his best to convince me, but I had already understood that this was a scam. I was firm and told him directly that I was not going forward, then cut the call.\n\nA little while later, he called again, trying to convince me once more. That completely broke my patience. I lost my cool and started giving him all kinds of bad words in Telugu, Hindi. Being from the Old City of Hyderabad, I didn’t hold back and let him have it with full Hyderabadi style swearing. Finally, I cut the phone on his face, and that was the last interaction I had with him.\n\nEven after that, he kept calling me again and again, trying to convince me. But I didn’t lift the phone. He even tried to massage me through WhatsApp which i didn't even open and ignored it. I completely cut off all contact, making it clear that I was done with this scam for good. \n\nEven after all this, a small part of me still wondered if maybe, just maybe, this could be a genuine business. But that thought completely vanished when another close friend (let his name be Bahubali) messaged me on Instagram. Bahubali told me that the same “friend ABC” had called him from an unknown number, the location on true caller was Maharashtra, claiming he was doing some kind of business and then Bahubali also told me that ABC tried to collect his family details from him. That was the final piece of evidence I needed—it confirmed 100% that this was a huge scam. I immediately explained everything to bahubali, from start to finish, and made sure he didn’t fall into the same trap.\n\nSUMMARY:\n\n**1. Unexpected Call:**  \nI got a call from an old college friend (ABC) claiming he was doing a business in “digital distribution of luxury products” and wanted to explain it in person.\n\n**2. First Meeting – Business Test:**  \nWe met at a café in Madhapur. Instead of explaining the business, he “tested” my business mentality with questions. He said he would check with his “senior partners” to see if I was eligible to join.\n\n**3. Meeting Senior Partners – Polished Act:**  \nAfter a few days, ABC arranged a meeting with “senior partners” at a high-end café. A female partner spoke politely, acting impressed, followed by a male partner. Everything felt staged.\n\n**4. Big Money Claim:**  \nThe male partner said joining the business required ₹3.8 lakhs for licensing. They claimed ABC had already paid ₹9 lakhs. They insisted on using an unfamiliar “Global Niyo Bank” instead of a normal bank account.\n\n**5. Suspicion Arises:**  \nWhen I asked ABC about the ₹9 lakh payment, he hesitated, stuttered, and avoided eye contact. This made me suspicious.\n\n**6. Attempt to Clarify:**  \nI met ABC again at McDonald’s and Starbucks, where he explained the business and even took a photo of me without permission. He also demanded my Aadhar and PAN cards to “book a slot” for a mandatory six-hour meeting.\n\n**7. Parental Advice:**  \nI told my parents. My father met the senior partners in Starbucks, Miyapur. The partners assured him it was genuine, but my father suspected a scam and advised me not to proceed.\n\n**8. Request for Proof:**  \nI asked ABC to show proof of the ₹9 lakh transaction. He avoided answering, repeatedly asking if I trusted him, and claimed I needed to show ₹3.8 lakhs in my account first.\n\n**9. Confirmation of Scam:**  \nABC’s evasive behavior, pressure tactics, personal data requests, and unusual bank instructions confirmed it was a scam.\n\n**10. Cutting Contact:**  \nI refused to proceed, cut off ABC after he repeatedly tried to convince me, and verbally expressed my anger in Telugu/Hindi in Hyderabadi style.\n\n**11. Repeated Harassment:**  \nHe kept calling and messaging, but I ignored him completely, cutting off all contact.\n\n**12. Final Confirmation:**  \nAnother close friend (Bahubali) told me ABC had called him through an unknown number from Maharashtra asking about business and family details. This confirmed 100% that ABC was running a scam. I warned Bahubali about it.\n\n**13. Red Flags:**\n\n* Huge upfront payments for unclear licensing\n* Staged meetings with polished partners\n* Pressure tactics and repeated “tests”\n* Requests for sensitive personal documents\n* Unusual banking instructions\n* Evasive answers when asked for proof\n\n**Lesson:**  \nTrust your instincts. Even friends can involve you in scams. Verify everything before sending money or personal details.\n\nPLEASE UPVOTE THIS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE AND BEWARE OF SUCH SCAMS !!!!!\n\nThank you for reading. I truly appreciate you patience and I'd advice you all to beware of these scams.",

However, compared to the other 2, the space on the inside looks a bit cramped. Also I dint come across any proper reviews on YouTube? Which is a bit sus! \n\nIf anyone knows how the response for this car has been and if it’s worth choosing over Tata & Mahindra, please help us come to a conclusion. \n\nOur must-haves are definitely enough space with good features.

There is a pilot escort vehicle and the tailing escort vehicle making a way for 2 black Mercedes benz C250s. 4 cars in total.\n\nI thought it was police as they have beacon lights and siren but not. Interestingly the last car had someone dressed in police uniform but he was sleeping with mouth wide open.\n\nEvery vehicle has a license plate which ends with 0393.\n\nThe last vehicle was a safari with number plate AP 9 G 0393 and when I look it online it is CBNs vehicle but a black scorpio instead of a beige safari what I have seen.\n\nThe benz cars had the plates\n\nTS 11 FC 0393\nTS 11 ED 0393\n\nBut looks like these are all fake plates.\n\nThis motorcade sped towards Begumpet airport. Trying to figure out who it was.\n\nEdit: It could be CBN and I found many different vehicles tagged with this license plate with this safari being one of them. Looks like politician cars are not available on vahan website. It either shows a wrong vehicle or says not registered.",

I went out today with the intention of checking some  sedans, and to my surprise, the options were very limited! I could only find around four sedans in the market – the Suzuki Ciaz, Hyundai Verna, Honda City, and VW Virtus /slavia– while the SUV section is overflowing with choices.\n\nIt’s interesting to see that only the high-end brands still have sedans, while most others have fully switched to SUVs. I get that SUVs are better suited for Indian roads with their high ground clearance, more space, and practicality, especially for families. But it feels like sedans, which once had a special charm, are slowly disappearing from the Indian market.\n\nHas anyone else noticed this trend? Would love to hear your thoughts and experiences",

      "content": "Sindhu Bhavan's (Sindhi Colony) 2 official board members have lied, betrayed us and conspired a fake 498a FIR.. # The Journey: Marriage, Deception, and Family Strife\n\nMy name is Pankaj Dodwani, a Sindhi born and raised in Hyderabad (Secunderabad). Growing up in Sindhi Colony, I had immense faith in Sindhu Bhavan and its community elders, inspired by my grandfather's(UdhamDas Dodwani) role in resolving disputes.\n\n# Marriage and Core Values\n\n* I got married in 2022 to a girl from Sindhi Colony.\n* I chose this proposal partly because she claimed to come from, and was willing to stay in, a joint family.\n* Crucially, I clarified my core values before the engagement, emphasizing that lying was non-negotiable. She agreed to everything.\n\n# The Breakdown of Trust\n\nWithin 3-4 months of marriage, I began noticing a pattern of deception and disrespect:\n\n* I caught my wife and mother-in-law criticizing my family (specifically my mother) on Instagram, with the chats instantly deleted.\n* I realized she was a pathological liar, supported and encouraged by her parents.\n* During an argument, she recklessly steered the wheel of a moving car. Her parents justified this by saying it was her \"hormones.\"\n* She lied about her past, , including but not limiting the number of marriage proposals she had discussed, her health conditions, her preferences.\n\n* She spread false rumors about my family to her friends and relatives.\n\n# The Pain of Betrayal and Our Child\n\nThe most painful betrayal involved the birth of our daughter:\n\n* She demeaned the conception of our baby girl to her friends as \"accidental drunken sex,\" claiming it was embarrassing to get pregnant early.\n* The reality is we both tried for 8 months to conceive.\n* When I told my mother-in-law about this, she taunted me, saying, \"You didn’t take my daughter out for dinners, that’s why she created an exciting life in front of her friends.\"\n* My mother-in-law was constantly involved, dictating my wife’s replies and even suggesting manipulative tactics like, \"Pankaj ko kiss karro, hug karro, pighal jaayega.\"\n\n# The Vicious Cycle of Forgiveness\n\n* The series of lies continued. Every time she was caught, her parents, grandmother, and relatives would beg for forgiveness, falling at my parents' feet and promising a genuine change.\n* This cycle of deception and begging for a chance happened 6 times in two years. I gave her multiple chances for the sake of our daughter, with my only requirement being honesty.\n* During her 8th month of pregnancy, she told her friends she would divorce me and hand over the baby because she wasn't as attached to her as I was.\n\n# The Final Break\n\n* After learning about the divorce threat, I offered to part ways openly. Again, her family profusely apologized, begged me to reconsider, and swore she would change.\n* In April 2024, after a period of separation, my wife called, swearing on our child for one last chance. I made it clear this was the final time, and that I would cut off all bonds with her relatives and parents. She agreed.\n* In November 2024, I was emotionally manipulated into attending her sister's wedding. Immediately after the wedding, she and her family \"started showing their true colors.\"\n* On November 23rd, 2024, she walked away from the matrimonial home over a small dispute, taking our daughter, without explaining her actions or intentions.\n* Seeing no other option, I offered a mutual divorce. Her father's only response was: \"Jo karna hai kar.\"\n\n# The Community and Legal Battle\n\n# The Involvement of Sindhu Bhavan\n\n* I reached out to the Board members of Sindhu Bhavan for help, explaining that my wife was neither addressing her issues nor agreeing to a divorce, essentially keeping me \"hanging.\"\n* Most members declined involvement, citing a lack of legal authority.\n* I then spoke to two specific board members—one a close family friend of my in-laws, the other an acquaintance.\n* In June 2025, the family friend called me, stating she had spoken to my wife and family, who had agreed to a mutual divorce. She assured me, gave me her word, and offered to sign the papers as a witness.\n\n# Betrayal and False Accusations\n\n* Relieved, I engaged my lawyer and had the papers drawn up.\n* On June 20, 2025, I sent my wife the divorce papers.\n* On June 21, 2025, she filed a 498A case against me and my family at the Women’s Police Station, Begumpet.\n* The two board members who encouraged me to get the papers made stopped answering calls and messages. I believe they conspired with my in-laws, using the pretext of help to facilitate the false case.\n* The FIR falsely claims I am harassing her and forcing a divorce, while the truth is my actions were based on the assurance of her mother's friend (the board member).\n\n# Current Status and Commitment to Fight\n\n* The Presidents of Sindhu Bhavan and Hira Hall were informed via a letter.\n* After a silent protest on July 26th, 2025, the community elders promised to bring my wife’s influential relative to the table. This promise has not been kept, and the President now claims the mediators are not answering their calls.\n* My family and I feel wronged and betrayed by the official board members of Sindhu Bhavan, believing they are safeguarding the rich and powerful.\n* I refuse to accept this injustice, viewing Truth as the highest form of power.\n* I have already sent a letter to the CM (which has been directed to the police) and written to the CDEW, Sakhi center, National Council of Women, and Telangana women safety regarding the alleged abuse of the legal system for vengeance.\n\n# My Resolve\n\nI will fight this till my last breath. My goal is for my almost two-year-old daughter to remember me as the man who never gave up, who stood by his morals, and who was unafraid to fight injustice. This post is meant to give courage to anyone facing similar suppression and injustice.\n\nUsed AI to summarize as was suggested.",

While we were discussing, two guys—one in his late 30s and the other in his early 20s—joined in. They spoke Bengali, but it was clearly not their first language.\n\nNow, these guys, self-proclaimed car experts (because they drive a Creta and a Harrier, obviously), confidently advised us:\n\n“Bhai, always go for international brands like BOSHEEE (Bose). Harman is an Indian brand.”\n\nMy friend and I exchanged looks of pure confusion. Seeing our doubt, they doubled down:\n\n“Think of it this way—Harman Baweja is an Indian name, right? So Harman must be an Indian brand!”\n\nAt this point, I couldn’t resist. I calmly explained that Bose is indeed an American company, but its founder, Amar Bose, was of Indian origin—and Bengali at that! His father Noni Gopal Bose was even a freedom fighter.\n\nAs expected, they immediately refuted it. So, I just told them to Google it in their shiny iPhones .The moment their smug expressions turned into pure shock and mild disgust was absolutely priceless.\n\nThey left the shop with much disgust .\n\nBtw we choose the Indian brand 😊😊😊",

      "content": "From the archive : Industrialists flock to West Bengal as communist CM Jyoti Basu becomes the darling of India's capitalists, 1990.. *What Bengal thinks today, the rest of India thinks tomorrow.\"*  \nFor generations of Bengalis, Gopal Krishna Gokhale's oft-quoted dictum of 1905 was nothing but a cruel joke. But that seems to be changing. After nearly three decades of industrial decline, the state's economy is poised to grow faster than ever before - thanks largely to a sympathetic Central Government which depends on Left support, and a communist leader who has become the darling of the country's capitalists.\n\n|| || |Jyoti Basu and (right) Asim Dasgupta: Overseeing an industrial revival  \n  \n\\*\\*Basu has found an able lieutenant in US-educated Finance Minister Asim Dasgupta, who has proved to be a tough but skilful negotiator.\\*\\*|\n\nThings were vastly different not long ago. West Bengal was the graveyard of Indian industry. There was no power for half the day, roads were pot-holed, phones didn't work. Businessmen who'd made their fortunes in the state had run away leaving dying industrial units and starving workers.Right from the late-'60s until recently, there were no substantial investments in industry or the crumbling infrastructure. The number of industrial licences issued slumped from 107 in 1974 to 25 in 1988.  \nThere was, in fact, disinvestment. An endless list of reputed Indian and multinational concerns shifted base from Calcutta. During those years, few corporate chieftains would have disagreed with Winston Churchill who paid a visit to the 'city of night' towards the end of the last century and wrote: \"I shall always be glad to have seen it... namely, that it will be unnecessary for me ever to see it again.\"  \nToday, as West Bengal's capital celebrates its 300th birthday, it's not quite the world's number one urban disaster area or the dying city Rajiv Gandhi thought it was. It's where the action is. At least for the Indian business community. Never have the dingy corridors of Writers' Building - the seat of the state Government - seen such a long procession of the well-heeled as in the last four months.\n\n|| || |**Prospects** **The Rs 3,000-crore Haldia petrochemicals complex.** **A Rs 900-crore 630 MW power plant at Bakreshwar.** **A Rs 700-crore steel plant at Malda.** **Steel plants at Durgapur and Burnpur being modernised.** \\*\\*Public sector units in telecom, electronics and currency printing to come up.\\*\\*|\n\nAnd 13 has become a lucky number for Jyoti Basu - about to complete 13 years as India's longest serving chief minister - much as he would personally be appalled at the analogy.Basu is now not only a key player in national politics but also the only politician who has met just about everybody who is somebody in the corporate world in recent times.\n\nAnd businessmen are vying with one another to shower praise on Basu. Some samples: \"He is the most civilised chief minister in India,\" says Russi Mody, chairman of the Rs 1,861-crore Tata Steel, the country's largest private company.\"He is the tallest statesman in the country, the Gorbachev of West Bengal,\" says K.S.B. Sanyal, president, Bengal Chamber of Commerce and chairman of the profitable, Rs 200-crore public sector Andrew Yule group.  \nIt's not just industrialists who are going ga-ga. Economists too laud Basu's pragmatic approach. \"He acts like an impartial umpire,\" observes eminent economist Amiya K. Bagchi. As for Basu himself, he characteristically remains unfazed by the applause. Last fortnight, while addressing a group of industrialists, he reiterated that the Rajiv Gandhi government had specifically discouraged investments in the state.\n\n|| || |\\*\\*\"The government-industry relationship is excellent.\"\\*\\* **K.S.B. Sanyal,** ***President, Bengal chamber of commerce*** **\"On the labour front, things are better now in West Bengal than anywhere else in the country.\"*****Russi Mody, Chairman, Tata steel*****\"The power situation in West Bengal is no worse than elsewhere in India. But it would help if supplies were managed better.\"Jagdish Sapru,** ***Chairman, ITC***|\n\nIf the clout that Basu has recently acquired in New Delhi has attracted droves of businessmen, the 76-year-old chief minister has found an able lieutenant in Finance Minister Asim Dasgupta, 44.Educated at the Massachussets Institute of Technology, US, Dasgupta taught economics at Calcutta University before joining the hurly-burly of politics. Of late, a new facet of his personality has emerged: that of a tough but skilful negotiator.advertisementIt was he who dealt with a host of industrialists before awarding the contract for the Haldia petrochemicals project to the Tatas instead of the R.P. Goenka group.  \nClearly, Dasgupta is a man in a hurry. In early-March, Sudarshan Birla landed up with a long face. After almost 10 years of dilly-dallying, he told the state Government that he wanted to back out of the Rs 250-crore polyester filament yarn (PFY) project he was planning to establish at Barjora in Bankura district.  \nDasgupta told him to give his opinion in writing. Next day, phone calls flew to Bombay. Two days later, representatives of the Ambani-controlled Reliance Industries were in Calcutta. And in less than a week, the state Government had signed a new memorandum of understanding with the Ambanis for the PFY project.  \nSuch quick decision-making was unthinkable six months ago. Still, though the political leadership is on the ball, it cannot be said that bureaucrats in the state have become as dynamic as their counterparts in, say, Maharashtra or Gujarat. Admits Commerce and Industries Secretary Bikram Sarkar: \"We have to do our bit to aggressively market the state's facilities.\"  \nadvertisementEven if many in the state doubt that the *abhaber sansar* (family perpetually in penury) in Bengal will be a thing of the past, the writing on the wall clearly indicates economic growth:\n\n* advertisement\n* A sum of at least Rs 3,000 crore is to be directly invested in the Haldia petrochemicals complex by mid-1993 and this is expected to result in indirect investments twice the amount on downstream industries resulting in employment for some 1.5 lakh people.\n* The Central Government recently agreed \"in principle\" to allow Soviet credit to be used to set up a Rs 900-crore 630 MW power plant at Bakreshwar. Further, clearances have been granted to set up a Rs 900-crore 500 MW power plant by the Calcutta Electricity Supply Corporation controlled by the Goenkas.\n* Two major telecom/electronics units involving an investment of more than Rs 150 crore are planned at Salt Lake, Calcutta, by two public sector concerns, Indian Telephone Industries, Bharat Electronics Ltd, and the multinational Siemens.\n* The two steel plants in the state at Durgapur and Burnpur will be modernised at a cost of about Rs 10,000 crore but this may take 10 years.\n* Other units in the pipeline include a Rs 700-crore steel plant in Malda to be set up by the C.K. Birla group and a Rs 300-crore currency note printing press at Salboni, Midnapur.\n\n|| || |**Problems** **Power position will not pick up before 1991.** **Centre unlikely to scrap freight equalisation on coal and steel.** **Centre unlikely to levy consignment tax on inter-state movement of goods.** \\*\\*Crores to be spent on revamping Haldia fertiliser plant and Santaldih power plant.\\*\\*|\n\nDasgupta, however, says that the real thrust to industry would eventually be provided by the growing purchasing power of the rural population. Reeling off figures, he notes: \"Food production has risen from 75 lakh tonnes to 115 lakh tonnes in the last 13 years; the daily wage rate in agriculture has jumped from Rs 5.60 to over Rs 20 in many areas; potato production has increased threefold; output of oilseeds has doubled since 1985; and horticulture is thriving.\" All this, he feels, indicates that a land reforms based agricultural strategy is paying off.  \nNot that everything is hunky-dory. For one, Calcutta's infamous load-shedding will return with a vengeance this summer, reviving memories of the late-'70s and early-'80s. Reason: new generating capacity would not come up till later this year.  \nIn the months ahead, the state electricity board will be appealing to the consumers to reduce consumption between 6 p.m. and 10 p.m. \"But from 1991 till around 1996, West Bengal should have surplus power,\" asserts Jahar Sengupta, chairman, ICI India Ltd, who has headed an official committee on power in the state.  \nBut most major industrial units are immune to power cuts as they now have their own captive generation. Besides, the situation is worse in some other states. \"It's just a question of better management of supplies so that lifts don't stop mid-floor,\" says Jagdish Sapru, chairman of the Calcutta-based ITC Ltd.  \nSite for Haldia project: Ambitious plansAs in the case of power, the state has suffered from an image problem in another area - labour. Myths about worker militancy have plagued West Bengal since the first Leftist government came to power in 1967. The fact is that the state has lost an unusually large number of mandays on account of lock-outs - not strikes - in sick industries.\"There has been malicious propaganda about the working class in Bengal,\" says Manoranjan Roy, general secretary of the CPI(M) affiliated Centre for Indian Trade Unions (CITU).  \nThe CITU spokesman says workers are willing to increase productivity if management is responsible and the technology and equipment used efficient. Numerous instances can be cited of surplus workers retiring from enterprises like Bata, Hindustan Motors, Jay Engineering, Texmaco, Dunlop and Gramophone Co. Many industrialists say that labour is today far more militant in Maharashtra and Kerala than Bengal.  \nIf labour and power are no longer perceived as constraining industry, the road transport sector still poses many headaches. At one level, the state Government is not averse to involving private companies in road construction.\n\n[Click here to Enlarge](https://archive.md/7IcYA#)\n\n[https://www.indiatoday.in/magazine/economy/story/19900415-industrialists-flock-to-west-bengal-as-communist-cm-jyoti-basu-becomes-the-darling-of-indian-capitalists-812436-1990-04-14https://www.indiatoday.in/magazine/economy/story/19900415-industrialists-flock-to-west-bengal-as-communist-cm-jyoti-basu-becomes-the-darling-of-indian-capitalists-812436-1990-04-14](https://www.indiatoday.in/magazine/economy/story/19900415-industrialists-flock-to-west-bengal-as-communist-cm-jyoti-basu-becomes-the-darling-of-indian-capitalists-812436-1990-04-14https://www.indiatoday.in/magazine/economy/story/19900415-industrialists-flock-to-west-bengal-as-communist-cm-jyoti-basu-becomes-the-darling-of-indian-capitalists-812436-1990-04-14There) is also a proposal to dig a tunnel under the river connecting Haldia with the Falta export processing zone, 60 km from Calcutta, using private funds.  \n  \nStill, the state's track record is pretty poor. For instance, the incomplete second Hoogly bridge in Calcutta stands like an eyesore today. The bridge should have been ready over a decade ago at a cost of Rs 85 crore. Instead, it won't be opened for more than a year, that is, after a sum of over Rs 300 crore has been spent on it.  \nThere are other monuments of industrial inefficiency: the Santaldih power plant which bore the brunt of the country's efforts to indigenise turbines and boilers, and the Haldia plant of Hindustan Fertilisers Corporation which contains a veritable museum of equipment from all corners of the world.[Click here to Enlarge](https://archive.md/7IcYA#)Huge sums have to be spent if these two units are to be revived. The same is true for most of the 62 jute mills in the state.  \nThough the Left Front Government is no longer being discriminated against by the Centre, many of its long-standing demands are unlikely to be conceded in a hurry.These include the doing away with freight equalisation on coal and steel imposed in the '50s which robbed industries in the eastern region of their locational advantages.  \nStill, the overall mood is upbeat. \"In no respect is West Bengal worse than any other Indian state for investors,\" asserts Sanjeev Goenka, vice-president, RPG Enterprises and incumbent president of the Indian Chamber of Commerce. Concurs economist Bagchi: \"The chances of an industrial revival in the state are much better than before.\"  \nThe seeds have been sown. Now, despite what cynics may claim, it's just a matter of time.",

      "content": "Development Under Left Front Government In West Bengal. Thirty Years of the Left Front Government in West Bengal\n\nThe Left Front Government in West Bengal completes thirty years in office on 21st June 2007. The uninterrupted existence of a Left Front government in a State for thirty years is a remarkable achievement.  This would not have been possible without the massive and unwavering support of the working people of West Bengal for the programme and policies of the Left Front Government. In the course of this long tenure, the Left Front government has set a shining example of pro-people governance by implementing land reforms and establishing a decentralised model of local self-government through a three-tier Panchayati Raj, which has empowered millions of rural poor and irreversibly changed their lives for the better. Its record in defending secularism, securing democratic rights and upholding probity in public life is also unparalleled. The Left Front Government in West Bengal continues to be an inspiration and source of strength for progressive and democratic forces across the country.\n\n \n\nHistorical Outline\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThe formation of the Left Front Government in West Bengal was a culmination of decades of struggles by various sections of the people — workers, peasants, teachers, refugees and students — under the leadership of the Left, and its biggest component the CPI (M).  Faced with the rising tide of struggles and the growing influence of the CPI(M) and the Left, the Congress regime which was formed after it undemocratically rigged the elections in 1972 resorted to a reign of semi-fascist terror in West Bengal. The CPI(M) and the mass organisations faced the brunt of this repression. 1,100 Party workers and close sympathisers were killed.\n\n \n\nThe Congress was severely punished by the people of the country for its authoritarian and anti-democratic actions in the general elections of 1977 and the Janata Party Government was formed at the Centre with Morarji Desai as Prime Minister. The Assembly elections in West Bengal were held shortly after the general elections in 1977. The people came out to vote in very large numbers to get rid of the reign of terror. The Left Front won by over three-fourth majority. \n\n \n\n \n\nWhile assuming office in 1977, the Left Front government was aware of the limitations of a State government in implementing pro-people policies within the existing Constitutional set-up. While the major responsibility of delivering services to the people was with the State Governments, financial resources were concentrated in the hands of the Centre. Keeping in mind this constraint, the Left Front government embarked upon a programme to provide immediate relief to the people and implementing alternative policies in spheres where the State government had some say. The major initiatives of the first Left Front government were to carry out thoroughgoing land reforms and establishing a vibrant Panchayati Raj. These historic initiatives broke the back of landlordism in the rural areas, empowered the poor peasantry and agricultural workers immensely and decisively changed the correlation of class forces in favour of the rural poor. Large sections of the rural poor, especially the dalits, adivasis and minorities, gravitated towards the Left and the CPI (M). This section continues to be the most stable mass base of the CPI (M) and the Left Front till date. Several other pro-people initiatives were also undertaken regarding workers’ rights and social sector development, which benefited different sections of the people: factory workers, unorganised workers, government employees, school and college teachers, students, youth, women and the refugees. Through their experience, the majority of the people of West Bengal came to recognise the Left Front government as a pro-people government, a custodian of their rights and a fighter for their cause. Therefore, since 1977, neither did the people ever look back nor did the Left Front government.\n\nLand Reforms, Democratic Decentralization and Agricultural Success\n\nLand Reforms\n\nThe land reforms initiated in West Bengal had three major components: (i) effective imposition of land ceiling and vesting of ceiling surplus land (ii) redistribution of vested land among the landless cultivators and (iii) securing of tenancy rights of sharecroppers (bargadars) through a system of universal registration of tenant cultivators (Operation Barga). As a result of this thoroughgoing land reform programme, West Bengal today has the most egalitarian land ownership pattern in the entire country. While West Bengal accounts for only around 3% of agricultural land in India, it accounted for over 21% of ceiling surplus land that has been redistributed in India till date. The total number of beneficiaries of land redistribution in West Bengal is over 28 lakhs, which is almost 50% of all beneficiaries of land redistribution in post-independence India. The security of tenancy rights provided to the sharecroppers under Operation Barga was also unprecedented in India. The total number of recorded sharecroppers had reached over 15 lakhs, which accounted for over 20% of the total agricultural households in the State. Over 11 lakh acres of land was permanently brought under the control of sharecroppers and their right to cultivate land was firmly established.\n\n \n\n \n\nAfter 30 years of Left Front rule, 84% of land in West Bengal is owned by small (2.5 acres to 5 acres) and marginal farmers (less than 2.5 acres) today, while the all-India figure is only 43%. Over 12 lakh acres of ceiling surplus vested land is lying with various State governments today but not being distributed among the landless. This shows the difference in the political will of the Left Front government in West Bengal and other State governments run by bourgeois parties. Moreover, around 56% of the total beneficiaries of land redistribution in West Bengal were dalits and adivasis. Dalits and adivasis also comprised over 41% of the registered sharecroppers. Till date, over 5.35 lakh women have been given joint pattas and 1.57 lakh women given individual pattas (ownership rights over land). Muslims have also benefited significantly from the land reforms programme. Proportion of land owned by Muslims in West Bengal is the highest among all Indian States which have a significant share (over 10%) of Muslim households in total rural households.\n\n \n\n \n\nFollowing the onset of the neoliberal policies in the decade of 1990s, whatever land reform measures were undertaken in most Indian States in the post-independence period were sought to be reversed. However, in West Bengal an additional 95,000 acres of land was acquired in the 1990s under the land reform legislation and 94,000 acres redistributed. These figures for the decade of the 1990s account for almost all the land acquired and over 40 per cent of the land redistributed in the entire country. The Left Front government has continued with the land redistribution programme. 30,000 acres of land was distributed among landless families in 2006-07.\n\nPanchayati Raj\n\nReorganisation of the system of local government was one of the most important of the institutional changes brought about by the Left Front government. In the process, West Bengal has created a history of participation of the common people through the process of decentralisation, which is unique in India. A system of democratic elections to local bodies at anchal, block and district level was instituted: gram panchayats at the anchal level, panchayat samitis at the block level and zilla parishads at the district level. Elections to these local bodies were held in June 1978. The newly elected panchayats were involved with the execution of land reforms. Panchayats took the initiative in exposing benami land holdings, ensured the identification of excess land and the declaration of vested land and were also given charge of ensuring the legal rights of recipients of vested land and bargadars over land. The panchayats were also involved in arrangements for the provision of institutional credit for the beneficiaries of vested land and for bargadars.  After the rural development projects were devolved to panchayats for implementation, the beneficiaries of land reform were given priority in the receipt of benefits from these projects. This was possible because through the panchayat election of 1978, a new leadership was established at the helm of the rural bodies from less privileged socio-economic backgrounds. The erstwhile village elite, including landlords and moneylenders, lost their dominance over the newly elected local bodies. The new leadership after 1978 came out of the tradition of peasant upsurge and struggle for land reform of the past three decades.\n\n \n\n \n\nWest Bengal is the only State in India to have had regular elections to local bodies every five years for the past 30 years. The aim has been to provide a substantial share of fiscal resources of the state to the local bodies. West Bengal was the first state in the country to make a serious effort at devolving funds from the state government level to the lower tiers of administration. The panchayats have also been assigned a large and substantial range of responsibilities that were earlier seen as under the purview of the district-level bureaucracy. The panchayats perform civic duties and undertake developmental activities like construction and maintenance of hospitals, schools and libraries, promotion of agriculture, cooperatives and cottage industries, child welfare activities, etc. They play an important role in the local-level planning and implementation of government schemes. Panchayats in West Bengal have played an important role in activities like mobilising cooperation for improving agricultural production, management of local resources, and identification of beneficiaries for housing, poverty alleviation and social security programmes. This has made the panchayats a critical institution of local governance in the West Bengal countryside.\n\n \n\n \n\nOver time, there has been substantial representation of the rural poor and of socially deprived groups like dalits and adivasis, as well as women, in the elected bodies. All this has helped to change the power equations in rural society as well as encouraged the social and political empowerment of social groups that were earlier marginalised. The proportions of dalit and adivasi panchayat representatives in all the three tiers were over 37% and 7% respectively, well over their share in population. Since 1995, one third of the seats and positions of chairpersons in the panchayati raj institutions have been reserved for women. It is, however, noteworthy that the actual representation of women exceeds one third as a number of women candidates also win in the general constituencies. Over 35% of the gram panchayat members are women. Also, 7 out of 17 zilla parishads have a woman sabhadhipati and 155 out of 351 panchayat samities have a woman sabhapati. In the late 1990s, the Panchayat Raj system in West Bengal was further strengthened by introducing gram sansads. These are the general councils of voters in every ward, that are required to meet twice a year with a minimum quorum of 10 per cent of voters to discuss the work done by the panchayats and utilisation of funds.\n\n \n\nSuccesses in Agriculture \n\nThis “walking on two legs” strategy of the Left Front government; implementing land reforms and the establishment of an effective panchayati raj in West Bengal; has not only led to the political empowerment of the rural poor but has also brought about a rejuvenation of agriculture in the State. Since the Left Front came into office in 1977, foodgrains production in West Bengal has grown at the rate of 6 per cent per annum, which is the highest among seventeen most populous States of India. From a food deficit State witnessing famines and food riots during the Congress rule, West Bengal has emerged as a leading food producer in the country under the Left Front rule. West Bengal has emerged as the topmost producer of rice, vegetables and fish among all Indian States. Cropping intensity in West Bengal has increased from about 136 per cent in 1980-81 to about 180 per cent in 2000-01, second highest in the country. This has been achieved through significant expansion of irrigated land area through small and minor irrigation projects. In the backdrop of the neoliberal policies being adopted by the Centre since early 1990s, agricultural growth has slowed down across the country. While agriculture grew at less than 2% in India during the Tenth Plan period (2002-2007), the growth rate of agriculture in West Bengal has been over 3.5%. The Left Front Government has not only been successful in insulating the agrarian economy of West Bengal from the acute agrarian distress currently being witnessed across the country, agricultural production continues to rise in West Bengal even today.\n\n \n\nIndustrialization: An Imperative\n\nFor most parts of its lengthy tenure, the Left Front government has had to encounter hostile governments at the Centre. There was a conscious effort on the part of successive Central governments, particularly those run by the Congress, to discourage industrialization in West Bengal since it was a Left ruled State. This was done both through a denial of public sector investment as well as licenses for setting up private industries. During Indira Gandhi’s tenure as the Prime minister in the early 1980s, a proposal for setting up an electronics complex in Salt Lake near Kolkata was shot down by the Central government on security grounds, because West Bengal was a border State! Permission for the Haldia Petrochemical project was withheld by the Central government for 11 long years. Moreover, the freight equalization policy for coal and iron ore robbed West Bengal, along with the other states in the Eastern region of India, of its locational advantage of being the most mineral rich region of the country. Following these discriminatory policies pursued by the Centre and the vitriolic anti-Communist propaganda carried out by the bourgeois media, which led to some degree of capital flight, West Bengal experienced industrial stagnation during the decade of the 1980s. Traditional industries like tea, jute and engineering were on a decline. This aggravated the unemployment situation in the State, especially in the urban areas, besides causing hardships for the workers in the sick industries. The need was felt to make special efforts to reverse the trend towards industrial stagnation and re-industrialize West Bengal.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nMeanwhile, a big policy shift had come at the national level when the Narasimha Rao led Congress Government adopted the “New Economic Policies” in 1991 following the dictates of the IMF and the World Bank. The neoliberal “economic reforms” initiated by the Central government abandoned the earlier emphasis on public sector investment, devised a strategy of liberalizing and deregulating the economy and laid emphasis on private capital, both domestic and foreign, as the main driver of economic growth. On the one hand these policy changes were clearly in the rightwing direction, which was opposed by the CPI (M) and the Left. On the other hand, it also meant an end to the discriminatory policy regime of the Central government, based upon licensing and freight equalization policy, which had caused enormous harm to the economic interests of West Bengal. It was in this backdrop that the he Left Front government had to devise its industrialization strategy. In September 1994, Comrade Jyoti Basu announced the Industrial Policy of the Left Front government in the changed scenario, which stated: “we are all for new technology and investment in selective spheres where they help our economy and which are of mutual interest. The goal of self-reliance, however, is as needed today as earlier. We have the state sector, the private sector and also the joint sector. All these have a role to play”. Following the adoption of the Industrial Policy, the industrial scenario in the state witnessed a turnaround, with important projects like Haldia Petrochemicals and Bakreshwar Thermal Power plants finally being set up.\n\n \n\nThis process of industrialization received further impetus after the Left Front government registered its sixth consecutive victory with Comrade Buddhadeb Bhattacharya as Chief Minister in 2001 and subsequently its seventh victory in 2006, with an enhanced majority. During the period from 1991 to 2006 a total number of 1,391 industrial units have been set up in West Bengal with a realized investment of Rs. 32,338.95 crore and creating direct organized employment for 2.03 lakh persons. The number of new industrial proposals in West Bengal is increasing progressively, especially in sectors like Iron and Steel, Chemical and Petrochemicals, Food Processing and Information Technology. Since the thrust of the West Bengal government’s industrial strategy is on employment generation, the focus is not limited to big industries alone. The state government has consciously provided policy support to small and medium enterprises, because of which the number of working small scale industries in West Bengal has increased from 19.1 lakhs in 1994-95 to 27.7 lakhs in 2000-01, with employment in small scale industries during this period increasing from 43.8 lakhs to 58.7 lakh. West Bengal now ranks first among all States in respect to both the number of working units and employment generation in the small-scale industrial sector.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nUnlike other State governments, which succumbed to the neoliberal prescriptions of the Centre, the Left Front government has followed an independent approach towards industrialization. Rather than following the policy of indiscriminate privatization of public sector units, the Left Front government has sought to strengthen them and earnestly tried to revive sick or closed industrial units. By repeatedly placing its views before the BIFR in the interest of industry and workers, the Left Front government has been able to obtain the sanction of revival scheme in respect of 79 units. Of these, 22 units have already been revived and about 25 more units are likely to be revived. SAIL has recently decided to invest Rs. 10,000 crore in the modernisation of the IISCO factory at Burnpur, which will be one of the biggest public sector investment projects currently being undertaken in the country. The Central government had earlier decided to privatize this sick unit. It was the protracted struggle waged by the IISCO workers and the principled position adopted by the West Bengal Government, which prevented privatization and has subsequently led to the revival of IISCO. Similarly, Bengal Chemicals, which had become a sick PSU, is being revived with Central investments worth Rs 440 crore. Recently, two public sector units, Coal India Limited and Damodar Valley Corporation have come together to acquire and revive the Mining and Allied Machineries Corporation (MAMC) based in Durgapur, a prestigious PSU that was closed few years ago. Closed units like Jessop and Dunlop have also been reopened.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nSome controversy has arisen recently over acquisition of agricultural land for setting up industries in West Bengal, especially in the context of the Tata Motors plant in Singur and a proposed chemical hub near Haldia. While the opportunistic gang-up of the entire opposition, from the ultra-Right to the ultra-Left led by the reactionary Trinamul Congress, has sought to pitch the debate in terms of industry versus agriculture, the Left Front government has repeatedly emphasized the need for a balanced and harmonious development of both sectors. The slogan of “agriculture is our foundation, industry our future”, put forward by the Left Front before the Assembly elections of 2006 received wide acceptance among the people.\n\n \n\n \n\nWelfare Initiatives and Constraints\n\n \n\nThe Left Front government in West Bengal has undertaken several pro-people initiatives to ensure all-round development of the State. The Left Front government has ensured significant expansion in the spheres of public education and health. The number of schools in West Bengal has seen a substantial increase in the post-1977 period, with the number of secondary and higher secondary schools registering a four fold increase, from 4600 in 1977 to over 22,500 in 2006. Accordingly, the number of students appearing for the secondary board examination has increased from a little over 2 lakhs in 1977 to over 7.5 lakhs in 2006. Around 80% of the indoor patients in West Bengal today are treated in Government hospitals. These reflect the commitment of the Left Front government towards human development. The Left Front government has also taken some important steps to provide social security to workers like introducing a provident fund scheme for unorganised sector workers for the first time in the country (nearly 7.9 lakh workers have already joined the scheme so far), providing financial assistance of Rs. 750 per month to workers of closed factories and tea gardens and providing social security to the construction workers. Another important development in the recent years from the point of view of self-employment in West Bengal is the phenomenal growth of Self-Help Groups (SHGs).  The total number of SHGs in West Bengal reached 3.8 lakhs in 2005-06, involving nearly 38 lakh persons, 90% of whom are women. This has opened up new possibilities for employment generation and women’s empowerment. When the seventh Left Front government assumed office in 2006, a dedicated Ministry to provide policy support to these SHGs was created.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThe Left Front government has also taken positive initiatives to uplift the Muslim minorities, who comprise over 26% of the State’s population. The West Bengal Minority Development Finance Corporation, which was formed in 1996, provides training as well as soft loans for self-employment and scholarships for meritorious students among Muslims. The reforms brought about in Madarsa education in West Bengal are also noteworthy, especially the modernisation of curriculum including introduction of vocational courses and computer training and bringing the recruitment of teachers in madrasas under the purview of the School Service Commission. It is significant that 65% of students studying in the madarsas of West Bengal are girl students and 12% of students are non-Muslims. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThere is no doubt that much more needs to be done as far as people’s welfare is concerned, especially for the socio-economically disadvantaged groups, as has been noted by the West Bengal Human Development Report 2004 or the Sachar Committee Report 2006. The Left Front government has been proactive in taking initiatives to do away with the shortcomings that continue to exist in its developmental effort. For instance, the Left Front government was the first State government to announce a sub-plan for minorities at the state level to implement the recommendations of the Sachar Committee. Several new initiatives have also been taken to improve the quality of public service in school education and public health in order to improve the human development scenario. However, the capacity of the Left Front government to deliver in the spheres of peoples’ welfare and social infrastructure have been severely constrained by the limited availability of resources. Unless the resource constraint is overcome, major welfare initiatives cannot be undertaken. While a part of the additional resources can be generated through internal resource mobilization, much depends upon the direction of economic and social policies of the Central government too. The power to take crucial economic policy decisions in India rests with the Central government and not the State governments.\n\n \n\n \n\nConclusion\n\n \n\nA big achievement of the Left Front government in West Bengal is its record in safeguarding democratic rights. Notwithstanding the vicious campaigns unleashed against it from time to time by its opponents, the Left Front government continues to remain firmly committed to democratic values and principles. Its impeccable record in upholding secularism, dealing with communal elements with a firm hand and defending the rights of minorities is a welcome exception to the programmatic or pragmatic communalism practiced by the bourgeois parties and the state governments led by them. While dalits and adivasis across the country continue to be victims of caste violence, it is indeed heartening to find that West Bengal has an almost zero rate of atrocities against dalits and adivasis. Born out of the struggles against authoritarianism and State repression, it is the commitment of the Left Front government to democracy, which has won it enormous credibility in the eyes of the people of West Bengal and enabled it to complete thirty years in office",

      "content": "How do clubs like Arjunpur situated in narrow lanes get to make such elaborate pandals? One pujo and whole Dumdum had to suffer for a week.. Firstly Shubho Bijoya to all. Now that the celebrations have slowly subsided, I genuinely want to know how do clubs like Arjunpur get to make such elaborate pandals in such narrow lanes without any responsibility whatsoever about the traffic around? Arjunpur this year was one of the most visited pandals in the city getting heavy rush due to their theme which I agree was beyond brilliant but the repurcussions unfortunately wasn't that brilliant. The crowd and craze for the pandal was more than even some of the most famous pandals in South Kolkata. However, if you're not aware, the Arjunpur pandal is situated in not a really vast space or a ground, it's constructed on two sides of a narrow lane which you can reach after wading through several different narrow lanes and a whole freaking baazar! Add to that, barricades on both sides of the roads so that cars can't pass through since the whole space is taken by the pandal. Not to forget the seperate baash baricade for the queue that already made a narrow lane even more narrow. \n\nAnd the result of all this - THE WORST RUSH AND CROWD EVER for the past one week in Dum Dum area even though the pandal is situated in Baguihati. Every rickshaw driver, auto driver, local I have spoken to have just ranted over how bad the crowd management was and how they were uncontrollable thanks to the mass promotion of the pandal through influencers even before Pujo started. Dumdum station was traffucked beyond imagination, the streets were literally choking as you could only see just scored and scores of people going to Arjunpur. Even the traffic authorities couldn't control the traffic and took the worst possible decision for locals who live in the area. They banned all rickshaws and totos throughout the four days from 4PM onwards to cross Hanuman mandir from Nagerbazar which meant that nobody could cross Dumdum underbridge to go to BT road side of the city unless you take an auto or a bus.\n\nAnd if you know autos in Dumdum, you also know how vast the queues are on normal days, now imagine a time like pujo with four times the rush only having to depend on autos and busses. And you would find THE WORST POSSIBLE CROWD ever in the busses. Scores and scores of rowdy young crowd getting down at Dumdum Station, getting into the bus for Arjunpur and creating absolute chaos, screaming kaacha bangla khisti  and creating nuisance without any shame. How does one even feel comfortable riding in such buses as a local even if it's just to go for one to two stops? Imagine scores of locals at the mercy of just autos and buses with maddening traffic, deafening mics blaring music and no ola/uber accepting short distances. \n\nEven though Dumdum has traffic but I have never seen such horrible mismanagement by the traffic dept on the roads ever and all of this just because of one single pandal. So my question is how do these pandals get the permission to conduct such high concept and big budget pandals that are sureshot a crowdpuller without any responsibility for the traffic and chaos it's going to create on the roads? How can one whole area that too far away from the pandal be affected due to it? If you've speaken to people who have visited the pandal, even they don't have good things to say about the crowd management there. Even at 4 am, the lanes were choc a bloc with people. There has even been an unfortunate accident in the pandal due to crowd rush because of which they had to shut down the pandal for sometime and move the main viral idol outside the pandal and close the interiors completely.\n\nIrrespective of big or small scale pandals, I think it's absolutely necessary even for clubs to take responsibility for their crowd management and work with the traffic police in tandem much before the opening of such pandals to have a rush and stress free Pujo for locals.\n\nAnd not just Dumdum, I think many will agree that this year was easily the worst managed Pujo traffic wise everywhere. Gariahat More and Tridhara were choking on a Panchami afternoon and with all right turns blocked for people, it was nothing short of a hellhole to drive through that area that too on an afternoon!",

I am hoping for a dinner cruise, but the cruise company has no customer service for people outside of India... so I will try to contact them after I arrive.  The only thing that is definite is the dates traveling to & from Mayapur because I have hotel reservations already.  Anything major that I missed?

      "content": "The girl I met at Gariahat. Yesterday around 9:30pm, in the middle of the Durga Pujo rush at Gariahat, I had one of those moments that makes you wonder about fate. I was on my way home when a girl stopped me to ask for directions to Deshopriyo Park. I tried to explain, but she still looked unsure, so I said, *“Come, I’ll walk you there.”*\n\nAnd that’s how it began — a short, unexpected walk on a festive evening.\n\nOn the way, I asked her name and where she was from. She said she’s from North Bengal and recently moved to Kolkata for a new job. That little detail — a new place, new beginnings — made her feel like a story unfolding right in front of me. We talked about small things, nothing extraordinary, yet it all felt effortless. It didn’t feel like talking to a stranger; it felt like catching up with someone I’d known for years.\n\nThere are two things I regret. First, I couldn’t tell her how stunning she looked in her black saree — simple, yet elegant, as if the whole festive night had dressed itself just to match her presence. The streetlights caught in her hair, her smile carried both shyness and warmth, and there was a softness in her eyes that made me forget the world around me. She wasn’t just beautiful in appearance; there was something rare about the way she carried herself.\n\nThe second regret — I didn’t ask for her number. Maybe it was shyness, maybe fear of breaking the charm of that short walk. I let the moment pass, even though part of me wanted it to last longer.\n\nIt was barely 10 minutes — just 10 minutes on a street full of people, lights, and the sound of dhaak echoing in the background. Yet somehow, those 10 minutes have become one of the best little memories I’ll carry with me.\n\nMaybe I’ll never see her again. Maybe she’ll always remain just *“the girl I met at Gariahat.”* But if by some chance she ever comes across this — thank you. Thank you for believing me in this city of strangers, for letting me walk with you, and for giving me a memory I’ll always hold close. 🌸\n\nP.S. I used ChatGPT to refine my writing.",

      "content": "I finally understood my dad in a way I never had before. So yesterday, while having dinner with my father, I finally understood something that had puzzled me for years.\n\nEvery Dussehra, without fail, my dad insists on buying me and my brother toy gifts. Even when we tell him it’s a bit expensive or unnecessary, he never backs down. Yesterday, during dinner, he casually recalled his own childhood—and suddenly it all made sense.\n\nHe told us how, as a kid, he would go to the Dussehra mela in his town with my grandfather, uncles, and aunts. My grandfather always bought jalebis for everyone, but never toys for economic reasons obviously, And as much as my dad loved those sweets, what stuck with him was that he never got to experience the joy of holding a new toy during those festivals.\n\nNow, I realize—he’s been carrying that memory with him all these years. And in his own quiet way, he’s making sure his children don’t feel the same lack he once felt. He doesn’t want us to inherit that little piece of sadness from his past.\n\nHonestly, it hit me pretty hard. It’s crazy how small gestures from parents often have such deep roots in their own childhood.\n\nTL;DR:\nMy dad always insists on buying us toys every Dussehra. Yesterday I found out it’s because, as a child, he never got toys at the mela—only jalebis. He doesn’t want his kids to feel the same disappointment he once did.",

      "content": "The couple in Gariahat. I was standing where I always do during Pujo — at the corner near the Gariahat crossing, balloons tied to my stick like a bunch of restless hearts tugging to escape. People hardly look at me; I am part of the background, a splash of red and yellow against the crowd’s blur. But last night, around 9:30, my eyes caught something they refused to let go of.\n\nA girl in a black saree.\n\nShe wasn’t like the others who rushed past me with shopping bags and laughter. No, she walked with a kind of hesitance, as if she hadn’t learned the rhythm of this city yet. That’s when she stopped a boy — not much older than her, maybe — and asked him for directions to Deshopriyo Park. I shifted my balloons so they wouldn’t block my view.\n\nHe tried to explain, waving his hands in the air, but she still looked uncertain. Then I heard him say, “Come, I’ll walk you there.”\n\nAnd just like that, my night changed.\n\nI followed, of course. Not too close, not too far. The balloons helped — people expect a seller to wander, to drift. I let the tide of the crowd carry me alongside them. They spoke in low voices, words snatched away by the dhaak and the vendors’ shouts. But I watched their faces.\n\nThe boy was eager, nervous. The girl — she was radiant. The streetlights bent toward her, I swear. Her smile was small but enough to cut through the chaos around. Black saree, loose hair, that softness in her eyes… she didn’t belong to this noisy bazaar. She was meant to be noticed.\n\nHe asked her name. I saw her lips form the words, though the sound didn’t reach me. North Bengal, that’s what I caught later, when she tilted her head just so, her earrings catching the light. New in the city. A stranger trying to make it her own.\n\nFor ten minutes, they walked, and I trailed behind, my balloons bobbing like witnesses. I imagined what he didn’t dare — to tell her she looked like the festival itself, to ask her to stay longer, to not let her vanish into the crowd.\n\nBut he failed. I saw it. The hesitation on his face when they reached close to the park, the moment slipping away. He didn’t ask for her number. He let her go.\n\nAnd so, when she melted back into the rush of people, I did not.\n\nI still had her reflection in my balloons, her voice in the air, her footsteps marked in my memory. She’ll come this way again — people always return to the same crossings, the same lights, the same corners of the city. And when she does, I’ll still be here, a balloon seller waiting in plain sight.\n\nShe may not remember the boy who walked her. But she’ll remember the night. And the balloons.",

But weekends are a mystery right now. Do I chase the best biryani spots? Explore hidden coffee houses? Or just get lost in the streets of North Kolkata like they say true Kolkatans do?\n\nWould love some “un-Googleable” recommendations , places you only discover if you actually live here. Bonus if it’s food, chai adda spots, or some low-key hangout places.\n\nAlso, curious what’s one thing about Kolkata you think only a local can explain?\n\n(P.S.

      "content": "Guide to Wheel Repair, OEM Wheel Purchasing and Wheel Fitment. I've been seeing a lot of damaged wheel stuff on /r/Justrolledintotheshop. With the bad weather coming decided to type up this guide that I hope can be helpful to some of you guys.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Wheel repair**:\n\nCost depends on your area and shop of choice. It can range from $100-200, generally. So what’s not repairable? Cracked spokes, chunks missing from the wheel, cracks on the face of the wheel, cracks/holes in the middle of the barrel and driving on a wheel. Some places may claim they can fix this stuff and they may actually do it, but in all honesty it’s just not that safe and bigger more reputable places will refuse the work. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nNon repairable examples:\n\n[Customer rim](http://imgur.com/bt6oFGk)\n\n[Customer Rim](http://imgur.com/jeSLoQe)\n\n[source legacygt.com forums](http://imgur.com/Xt9cgXV )\n\n[This is not repairable because the wheel bent so much it caused the crack in the face - customer’s rim](http://imgur.com/40ALiVZ)\n\n[Don’t even think about it](http://imgur.com/HPDVFD1)\n\n[This is a wheel that was driven on after the tire blew out](http://imgur.com/pZ5Sq8k). Most of the time these are not repairable because the lips of the rim get flattened while riding on it. Now if you only went a few feet or so then it can probably be repaired, but I’ve seen wheels that looks like the owner drove for miles on it.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nChrome clad wheels are not repairable. Some common examples of cars that come with chrome clads are Chrysler 300’s, Ford Edges, Cadillac Escalades, PT Cruisers and others. If you feel behind the spoke you’ll be able to feel that it’s a plastic piece on top of it.  These are not repairable because the plastic piece itself isn’t repairable and you cannot buy that separately. If you need a replacement for one of these you’ll either need to buy a used one, a replica or new from the dealer. Some of the chrome clads don’t even have replicas made for them or the replicas were discontinued. \n\n[A chrome clad from a Chrysler Pacifica](http://imgur.com/yAjU0Ju)\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWheels can also be deemed too thin to repair. This happens when the wheel has had previous repairs and there’s not enough metal to cut into again. Some wheels, though rare, can only be repaired once or twice because of the thickness from the factory. There’s an Audi Q7 wheel like this. There are also wheels that have machined faces, which can only be cut a certain amount of times before it starts eating into the windows of the rim (aka the area in between the spokes or machined area). If you don’t mind going with a full color wheel then these can be repaired by choosing a custom color to powdercoat it in or having it painted all silver.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo what is repairable then? Well you can repair curb rash, scratches, certain gouging if it’s not too deep, bends on the front or back and cracks on the back lip that do not go through the tire bead.\n\n[Easy curb rash repair](http://imgur.com/7JJgLFV)\n\n\nRepairing cracked wheels gets a bad rep because some places just do a shit job. I cracked one of my forged wheels 6 years ago and had it repaired. I’ve been driving on it ever since, both on the street and track. Examples of bad repairs:\n\nhttp://imgur.com/vynwAaQ\n\nhttp://imgur.com/IUqzRcY\n\n&nbsp;\n\n[When done right something like this is easily repairable](http://imgur.com/qurhbpJ) and will last. Now if you have multiple cracks, then you’ll most likely need a replacement. Will update with a cracked wheel that was repaired appropriately. \n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nHub Bends  \nHub bends are when the center of the wheel, the hub area is bent sort of causing the whole wheel to twist. Some places will repair minor hub bends, others won’t. It comes down to if it’s cost effective or not for the shop because of the amount of time it takes to do.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n------------\n**Wheel Purchasing**\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nNext up, getting the part number. For this we’ll be using www.transwheel.com  This site’s design and operation may suck, but it is the best source for this particular info. You must put the www in front or the site won’t work. They finally just updated to work on the latest IE and Safari. Other browsers I don’t know.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nNow you’ll want to click [Login as Our Guest](http://imgur.com/fZNgKLq) (retail)\n\n&nbsp;\n\nHere you put in your vehicles information, wheel size and spoke design. This is a third party company inputting all of the info so some of the info may be slightly off. For example you might have a 2008 BMW 325ci and when you put that info in the correct size doesn’t come up. In these situations the boxes as all years, put bmw, model would be all models then I would add in  size and the amount of spokes and look at the pictures to match it up. They sometimes get info like the lug pattern wrong or for some reason they’ll round or put it in inches. Almost all Honda/Acura 5 lug wheels are 5x114.3. Transwheel will sometimes round up to 5x115 or list it as 5x4.5. Its best if you know your car appropriately to recognize discrepancies and know you’re looking at the right item.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAlright lets say I have a 2005 Acura TL and need a new 17in rim that has 5 spokes. [I put in my info and hit search](http://imgur.com/kjd6YXp).  Two wheels come up that look the same, but there’s a note saying the valve stem area is different. So lets pull up the pictures. Click on one and it will load more info about the wheel, [then you can click the picture](http://imgur.com/NVg00lG) to see a bigger image along with OEM part numbers. Alright so I determine the top one is the one I have with the smaller valve area. [Now the number I’m going to want to use is the ALY number, in this case its 71733](http://imgur.com/QWcQfgl) which is its Hollander number. With some wheels you’ll see multiple numbers listed under the Hollander column, the one that has the ALY number is the main number used by all places, while the others are alternate numbers that were mostly used when the wheel was first released and a main number wasn’t set yet.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n[Now I'll go to ebay and search rim 71733](http://imgur.com/jM4DJRx). Most wheels will be refurbished Certain wheels have replica versions, this being one of them. The titles of the Replicas normally will say new replacement. When you read the descriptions it should specify if it’s OEM refurbished, OEM new, OEM used or a Replica. The replicas all tend to be made in China and will be cheaper than the OEM counterparts. If you need to save a few bucks this is a cost effective way.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAs most things sold on ebay there are good sellers and bad sellers. Here’s a list of some of the companies I deal with on a daily basis and would recommend. \n\n* AAAA Hubcap Heaven\n* Blackburn’s Wheels\n* Detroit Wheel and Tire\n* Factory Wheel Warehouse\n* Midwest Wheel and Tire\n* The Wheelership\n* The Wheel Gallery\n* World of Wheels\n\nRemember there are plenty of others. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nNot sure of the correct info on your wheel? Take the wheel off the car on the back side of the spokes you’ll be able to find all relevant info such as width, diameter, offset and part number. The offset will generally say ET or IS followed by the number. Some wheels will have the info on the face of the wheel under the center cap if its a cap that covers the lugs, and others may have it on the back of the hub rather than the spokes. Certain wheel styles have different variations of width and offset depending on the car, so just make sure you get the appropriate one. Also be aware that if you drive a RWD car, the sizing is probably staggered with the rear widths being bigger than the fronts.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSidenote: eBay’s compatibly chart does NOT work for OEM wheels. If you’re still unsure if you’re looking at the right wheel you can always ask the seller and they should be able to help.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n---\n**Wheel Fitment**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nNow for wheel fitment. The places you’re going to find, deal with OEM wheels and will not be able to help too much if you want to do cross platform wheels, say Mercedes wheels on an Audi. This is were you’re going to have to do the leg work as so many variables come into play for wheel fitment such as ride height, camber settings, wheel width, wheel diameter, wheel offset, lug pattern, center bore, caliper clearance and spoke design. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nThis offset calculator is a great place http://www.1010tires.com/Tools/Wheel-Offset-Calculator to see how adjustments in width and offset will effect the positioning of the wheel. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo an example. I drive a 2004 Audi s4. The lug pattern is 5x112 which is also used by Mercedes. I know I want a 19in rim so I go to www.transwheel.com [put in this info and hit search](http://imgur.com/GnmTWli). Alright 201 possible wheels. Let me just change how many I can see at a time and scroll through. [Where it says page size, if I change that to 201 and hit change it’ll show me everything. So just match whatever you’re looking at to that and you can see everything](http://imgur.com/vD0VzUz).\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIf I click into any rim I can see what car it came from.If I want pricing on items I’ll use that aly number on ebay. This is where you’ll have to do your own research on fitment. Sure I can use numerous Mercedes wheels, but I’ll probably need hubrings because of the different hub sizes and possibly different lug bolts as older Mercedes had different size lug bolts than Audis. I can compare widths and offsets to what I have and figure out what will be the perfect fitment that I want. Sometimes offsets will not be listed but googling or check out auction descriptions will sometimes give that info. Also again be aware of discrepancies. In this Audi example I found a set of Land Rovers I was interested in that could be had for extremely cheap. I soon realized it was the only Land Rover listed and after some googling found that transwheel had the wrong lug pattern listed for that specific wheel. And because most wheel companies pull their info from transwheel, they too all had the wrong info on their ebay listings.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWell I hope this helps some of you this winter season and **feel free to ask any questions** you may have.",

      "content": "Lifetime review: 1993 Toyota T100 SR5. I have completed my 25 year evaluation of the [1993 Toyota T100 SR5 4WD MT](http://imgur.com/a/dBO211e).  I began my observations in 1993 at the age of three when my dad bought the new truck from a dealership on Broadway in Nashville.  For the first twelve years I paid close attention to passenger comfort, passenger safety, and kid-appeal alongside several other cars.  In 2005, I obtained my learner permit for the purpose of rating the pickup for drivability, utility, and reliability.  My evaluation finished on Wednesday after recording the results of the vehicle's overall safety.\n\nFor the most part, the truck remained in its stock form with the notable exceptions of a four-inch suspension lift, three-inch body lift, 12.5x35 tires, and Line-X bed liner.  It sported various combinations of tool boxes, bed enclosures, and brush guards depending on its use.  Usage ranged from every-day-commuter to workhorse to show truck.  Driving conditions included temperatures between -30 and 115 degrees Fahrenheit, medium off-road, deep snow, snowy and icy hills, mild flooding, and extreme low visibility.\n\nI'll begin my review with some ratings for general catagories that I think are important, and then I'll expand on those ratings below.\n\n* Comfort: 5/10\n\n* Drivability: 3/10\n\n* Reliability: 10/10\n\n* Utility: 7/10\n\n* Appearance: 7/10\n\n* Safety: 6/10\n\n\n\n# Comfort: 5/10\n\nThe regular cab has a single row of seats that are something between bench and bucket seats.  The driver seat adjusts forward and backward with the center console/armrest that folds up to reveal a center \"seat\".  The passenger seat adjusts independently, and both sides are capable of seatback tilt adjustments that are limited by the rear bulkhead.  Legroom is average or slightly small, and a small passenger could recline comfortably by sacrificing a small amount of leg room.  The center seat position is almost unusable because of interference between an occupant's legs and the floor-mounted shifter, but it works in a pinch.\n\nHeadroom is plentiful, and visibility is excellent.  All four roof pillars are narrow, and blind spots are easy to check.  Side windows are large and extend back well beyond the occupants' heads.  The center of the rear window slides open for improved airflow.\n\nThe lack of a real bench seat means that laying down is possible but not really comfortable.  Attempting to fit two people horizontally quickly becomes akward.  The seat material is slightly firm, and extended road trips may require frequent rest stops.\n\nThe steering wheel is tilt-adjustable, but when I move it to its highest position, my hands frequently hit the windshield.  The instrument cluster is difficult to see near twilight but otherwise well designed.\n\n\n\n# Drivability 3/10\n\nMy only experience driving the T100 was after it had been lifted, so this may not be the most accurate assessment.  The tall tires left the truck with a verry vague sense of steering, and the \"heavy-duty\" shocks are too week to handle the extra leaf springs that were used to lift the rear end.  It takes several seconds for the truck to recover from even mild bumps, and the stiff springs make the ride very harsh unless loaded down.\n\nThe relatively long suspension and soft tires handles large bumps far better than expected, but tire roll and vehicle rollover are very real concerns.  Excellent visibility makes low-speed maneuvers easy to judge, but the long wheelbase and four-wheel-drive severely limit the turning radius.\n\nThe three-liter V6 is extremely underpowered for the heavy chasis and tall wheels, but the transfer case has a crawler gear for extreme torque needs.  The part-time 4WD system contains two open differentials and no center differential.  Forward grip is lacking, and slippery surface take-offs require a delicate right foot.\n\nThe transmission is fairly clunky, but it provides good feedback.  Clutch engagement is very tricky.  This is a very difficult transmission for a new driver.  The ABS is acceptable quality and useful when the bed is unloaded.\n\n\n\n# Reliability: 10/10\n\nHoly crap!  I'll never give another car a 10/10 for reliability after seeing what's possible!  This truck has been abused since the early years, and the only major problem was a head gasket failure that was covered under the factory waranty.  It's been in several crashes, but repairs have always been limited to body panels and one condensor.  The air conditioner still blows cold, and the heater will cook you alive.\n\nHowever it did develop a few problems after a head-on collision with an Interstate dividing wall last year.  Following that collision, the driver window sometimes sticks closed (never sticks open), and the cruise control no longer works.  I didn't get a chance to fix these issues before the end of my test.\n\nOther problems are as follows:  The clutch pedal bracket snapped from rust at about 200k miles and had to be replaced by the updated version.  The speedometer failed around 220k miles requiring the replacement of the instument cluster (including the odometer).  ...  ... Actually that's it.\n\n# Utility: 7/10\n\nDat 8 foot bed doe!\n\nThis is a pickup truck; it hauls stuff.  With the upgraded suspension, I had no problems hauling a half pallet of sod.  The bed is a little high, but I can still get my four wheeler in with some ramps.  With only 2.4 seats, you can't carry a family, but it's great for a single dad with a construction job or a high-school boy.\n\nMy favorite addition was a foldable canvas bed topper.  My dad got one from a company called Safari Tops back in '94, and it did a great job protecting cargo from wind and rain.\n\nWith the weak powertrain, towing capacity is pretty limited, but I use it to haul a small trailer sometimes.\n\n\n\n# Appearance: 7/10\n\nIn stock form, it looks pretty ordinary.  It came with a dark green color that didn't really stick out, but I repainted it with BMW Midnight Black.  It usually had some sort of stainless steel bull-nose brush guard on the front, but that took most of the force of the Interstate divider crash that killed the cruise control.\n\nAfter the crash, I decided to go all black.  I replaced the old polished aluminum wheels with some simple seventeen-inch wheels, and I put some new black canvas on the topper.  Everyone likes the way it looks.  It doesn't really stand out, but I get compliments whenever people see me by it.\n\nKids like it.  Bros like it.  Women like it.\n\nHowever, it does not *sound* great.  The horn sounds like the roadrunner, and the engine is forgetable.\n\n\n\n# Safety: 6/10\n\nThis truck has seen several crashes.  Most of them were not severe, but I feel like the only real safety feature is its weight.  It does not have airbags, and the frame is remarkably stiff.\n\nThe first crash happened in '98 on an icy winter morning on our way to school.  It was pretty simple; while taking a turn at an intersection going downhill, all the tires lost grip.  I hesitate to call this a crash because we stopped with the front passenger wheel hanging far enough over a ditch to tip the whole truck in.  There were no real injuries, just some painful shuffling to get out of the truck sideways.  Most crashes ended up like this including a failed attempt to tow a lawn mower out of a ditch.\n\nThe next most severe crash was that Interstate wall I keep mentioning.  I was merging onto the highway when I hit a small snow bank made by a plow.  The front end got kicked into the four-lane road.  I tried to counter steer and accelerate in 4WD, but that didn't do anything.  I slammed on the brakes and watched the wall fly at me.  I was going between 10 and 15 mph when I hit.  The brush guard took most of the force, but I was a little sore the next day and had bruised knees.\n\nThe incident that finally killed the T100 happed last Friday while I was hauling some furniture to my new house with my friend David.  We were driving through an intersection in the rain when a Versa took a left turn from the oncoming lane.  When I first hit the brakes, we were going about 40 mph. The collision deflected us into the traffic light pole.  I hit my knees on the dash, scraped my elbow on the door, and bit my lip.  The seatbelt hurt more than anything.  David was the real victim; something about the multiple impacts from the car, pole, and couch hurt his back.  He's rapidly improving, but I'm not impressed with the way the cab got squished.\n\n\n\n# Conclusion: 8/10\n\nWould buy again.  I want to sit here for the next few hours and type out all the stories and memories that went with that truck, but I'll save that for a rainy day.  There's just something special about that one vehicle that you can always count on, especially when it's your first car.  When you've been with a car for 25 years, you develop a bond with it that can't be replaced.\n\nThere are memories from all stages of my life that didn't happen in another car.  This truck will never leave me.",

      "content": "I wish Porsche would offer a 911 safari car from the factory.. I want to start by saying that I am sure that Porsche has a whole team of much smarter people then I am, of market researchers who have already looked over this idea. I am sure they have decided there is not a big enough market to make the time and investment worthwhile. Please suspend some disbelief and give me a chance to explain why I think this is a good idea. \n\nI wish and think that Porsche should offer 911 safari spec cars from the factory. Porsche and the 911 has a rich racing history that Porsche loves to capitalize on to sell cars. The 911 Turbo and GT cars are a small part of Porsche's overall sales, but they help drive the sales of their \"lower\" models. \n\nPeople who buy 911s aren't just purchasing a supercar they can use every day, they buy into Porsche's history. But Porsche doesn't capitalize on their rally racing history even though it's just as vibrant as their circuit racing history. \n\nI think they should offer a 911 safari spec car, and there are several reasons why. As Doug has pointed out in some of his videos since the Ford Raptor entered the market, off-roading in all forms has been a considerable market. The Ford Bronco took over the internet on its release date. There is so much hype over the new land rover defender too. The Jeep Wrangle regularly makes big sales numbers and has a significant following. Have you seen the resale value on used Wranglers?\n\nDo I think that a 911 safari spec car will sell anywhere near a Jeep? No, of course not, but I believe there is a market for a 911 rally car. I think there are people out there that look at these large offroader SUVs and think, \"what if I could have an offroader sports car.\" Thus the 911 safari. There is an augment that one could buy an STI and have a rally car. But if we are real with ourselves, it still needs aftermarket work to be off-road capable. People might also want to spend more than 35K+ plus off-roading parts on their car.\n\nPorsche should offer the safari in limited numbers, such as their GT cars. Leh Keen said, \"So total budget for the customer should be about $120,000.\" I am sure people would pay much more for a factory spec car with a warranty. The knowledge that Porsche engineers worked on this car would carry all the weight Porsche would ever need to sell these cars. \n\nIn true Porche, fashion have an option list a mile long. Want the optional 5\" lift kit, no problem we have that. Want color match rally lights on the roof, we got you fam. Want RWD with big trail tires and gold rims? Just check the box and give us your money. \n\nI genuinely think there is an off-road 911 market for a factory car with a warranty. I personally would love to see Porsche embarrass this market and show us that the everyday supercar can also be just a super offroad.",

      "content": "1975 RHD Series III 109 Land Rover. I'm posting this note looking for some advice regarding my Rover. Here is the story in a nut shell: I purchased this truck in South Africa while posted there (State Dept.). It is a South Africa Army \"surplus\"/game park vehicle. It is a 109 with the safari top and has a 2.6 engine in it. It is all original. Body wise it is sound but needs paint. Mechanically I've had all the underpinnings (suspension, brakes, diffs) reconditioned or replaced and works well. It is titled and tagged here in VA (long story about that process). My problem is the drive train. While it runs ok the engine is in need of a rework and parts may be an issue. I would like to keep it as original as possible but at the same time currently it just sits in the garage looking lonely because it is not road trip ready. I need to fix it so I can drive it or sell it but I'm not sure what it is even worth. Any suggestions are appreciated.\nhttp://www.ezimba.com/work/140922C/ezimba18089518861200.jpg\n\nhttp://www.ezimba.com/work/140922C/ezimba18089584953800.jpg\n\nhttp://www.ezimba.com/work/140922C/ezimba18089532962800.jpg\n\nhttp://www.ezimba.com/work/140922C/ezimba18089565567500.jpg",

Sorry if this has been answered, but searching didn't yield much. \nI am moving from CO to CA and want to ship my project truck (1985 FJ60) out to my new home. It runs, but int really the type of truck you wanna drive more that 200 miles at once. I contacted a few shippers and they all want ~1400 to get my truck to me. For only 1200 miles that seems sort of steep. Also, I am nervous a driver will show up with a car carrier and between the 5 inch lift, 35\" tires, and full safari rack the truck wont fit. Any other ideas? I am not opposed to renting a truck and trailer but most rental places dont rent pickups bigger than half ton. \n\nThanks\nTM",

It runs ok but could be alot better so i want to restore it. The problem is that i know little about cars. So i was wondering if its possible to restore and replace moat of the parts in the car with modern ones (if thats even possible) so that i wont have to keep finding old parts for it and having to keep fixing the old and broken parts. And i want to know how much that would cost approximately. Also whats the best website to learn how to fix cars and restore them.",

      "content": "Time to bring back the AMC Eagle.. Edit: Some of you seem to think I’m advocating getting rid of the Wrangler. Incorrect. I’m talking about another vehicle in the Jeep showroom to appeal to a different demographic. \n\nWranglers are miserable road trip vehicles but their 4wd system is awesome- particularly in bad weather. Jeep has great brand equity and a long history of repurposing stuff to stay relevant. Witness: the new Gladiator. \n\nSo here’s what I’m proposing: a Wrangler that sits a little lower, is a little more freeway friendly, a bunch more aerodynamic, and (maybe) has three row seating. You know- a 1987 AMC Eagle. \n\nWhat I’m imagining is the current Wrangler. Push the body out over the current fender flares and the current frame rails/metal bumpers. This will provide more interior room and a little tumblehome without increasing actual footprint. Pushing it forward 4-6 inches also allows more slope to the windshield for better aero. Drop the entire thing 2-3 inches and chop an inch out of the roof to make it visually shorter without sacrificing headroom. Keep the classic Wrangler tail lights but style the front like a GC with round headlights. Keep the running gear as-is, very minor tweaks to shocks/springs. Minor (if any) changes to electronics/switchgear/etc. As much as possible should be a direct carry over from the Wrangler to keep costs low and push its Jeep heritage. \n\nThe whole goal here is to leverage brand equity and sunk R&D costs to build a Subaru Outback competitor without needing to develop a new platform. \n\nCall it a Jeepster or Commando or Safari and build it on the Wrangler chassis so it falls under truck EPA regulations.\n\nCons: Jeep build quality and sophistication. Poor fuel economy. Truck(ish) ride and handling. \n\nPros: It’s a Jeep for soccer moms who don’t like the Wranglers fuel economy and lift over height. It has to meet truck EPA standards, not car. Other than body design and crash testing most components are already designed and tested.",

The Sport version has the same motor as the normal S, but it has a much stronger transmission.  It also needs the 300-mile battery pack due to the peak power required for the high acceleration.\n\n2. The water cooling on the battery is actually thermal regulation.  He said that l-ion batteries last MUCH longer if they are charged at a certain temperature.  When plugged into the wall, the wall voltage is used to warm or cool the battery to the appropriate temperature prior to charging.\n\n3. The charging system is designed in such a way that it can take ANY voltage, AC or DC. (there's a control box inside)\n\nDemo guy:\n\n4. The computer system is linux-based\n\n5. The browser is custom written but uses the webkit backend (like safari)\n\n6. There are app downloads, but they are approved by tesla.\n\n7. It has 2 usb ports in the front, and 2 in the back.\n\n8. It has a hard drive (he might have meant internal flash hard drive) that can store music (didn't ask size)\n\n9. It has a 3G connection and will serve as a Wi-Fi hotspot to car occupants.\n\n10. It can reverse tether to a phone and use the phone's internet connection if you don't have the 3G subscription or are not in a service area for the Tesla's band (don't know what freq it is)\n\n11. The handles are pop out and will pop out if you approach the car with the key fob or touch them (like those touch sensitive lamps or a touchscreen, assuming the car is unlocked)\n\nAlbum (lol blur): http://imgur.com/dohFz,3W4KP,SobQf,Xq9C8,Yodp5,joRms",

      "content": "Need a van/truck/SUV recommendation. So, the wife just found out that kiddo #3 is on the way. Good news for us, bad news for our driving situation.\n\nObviously, fitting four kids (all under 4 years old) into a 4.5 person vehicle isn't ideal for anything longer than a trip to the grocery store (and even that's pushing it).\n\nSo I'm looking at larger vehicles, while struggling with my mistrust of minivans. I'll spare you my (and my friends') tales of woe, but the long and short of it is that I don't really trust their drivetrain reliability, and have no use for the offset steering wheel column driving experience (/r/firstworldproblems calling!) that some models have (90s Caravans, 00's Toyota Sienna). \n\nAlso, I'm **comfortable spending $4,000, to $6,000.** I'm very handy in my own right so I'm not beholden to a stealership or shady mechanic. I also have a family connection to a shop with a lift and tools so if I get a project or handyman special I can get it fixed for cheap(er). \n\nWe have currently a later-model Impala (such vanilla-y goodness) and a Chevy Blazer (S-10 chassis, 4-door, 4WD). The Impala is good enough to keep around as we are the original owners, it's reliable thus far and it gets decent gas mileage. We live in Western NY so we get snow, but we are suburbanites and hard-core 4WD isn't *mandatory.*\n\nThe Blazer is going to have to get changed out for something else with a third row of seating. The unfortunate thing about a third seat is that pretty much rules out any modern station wagon (that I can think of).\n\n**Currently under consideration:**\n\n-    Astro/Safari (so far my favorite option)  \n-    Chevy Traverse, as the wife thinks the Astro is *too* van-like  \n-    Trailblazer EXT (apparently the EXT has a third row of seats)  \n-    Dodge Durango (~2004 vintage)   \n\nFord Explorers are not on the list because I had a coworker with one (a 2002, I think) and, to understate, they *hated* it. Let's just say I have been regaled with many tales of woe about that vehicle. Unless something major changed, I'm not particularly interested.\n\nFor styling, I'm fine with an Astro BUT the wife thinks it's too much like a van, and even called it a full-size van (my protestations be darned!) She wants something non-van-like, or at least not as van-y as an Astro.\n\nTo aid in my quest, I've paid for a year subscription to [Consumer Reports](http://www.consumerreports.org/) as I've always had a ton of respect for their ratings and reviews (back to the pre-internet days of inch-thick car rating books). I found an interesting [MT article](http://www.motortrend.com/roadtests/suvs/1105_three_row_crossover_suv_comparison/viewall.html) that turned me on to the Durango. I'm also happy to hear your personal anecdotes and experiences with any of the vehicles on the list or if you really want to recommend something I haven't mentioned.\n\nSo, is there anything I'm missing? I know I'm going to have to lay down my dreams of improved fuel economy. Is there such a thing as a bulletproof, cheap, minivan that I'm overlooking? A funky wagon with a third seat less than 15 years old (1995 Caprice/Roadmaster wagons are a *little* too old for my preference)? Should I take this question to a different sub? What say you?\n\nAlso, there are \"auction\" dealers around - are those something I should be looking at, or are they too much of a crapshoot?\n\n**TL;DR:** Looking for a reliable ride for a young family of five for (hopefully) under $6,000. There's lots of time before baby #3 arrives, so I can sit back a little and wait for A Really Great Deal if I have to.",

      "content": "Should I Be Shaving My Back Hair Because Someone Doesn't Like It? . **TLDR**; I have body hair, the person I'm talking to kind of implied that my back hair in particular was a deal breaker. I was going to get rid of it anyways, but I feel weird knowing that someone wouldn't want to be with me just because of that. Should I leave them or should I just suck it up and shave?   \n  \nI am a female, but I am from a background where the hairy genes are STRONG. I find myself harrier than my male friends or the guys I talk to. I have very prominent hair all over my body, which I think is normal, and I don't shave because I dress very conservatively and I feel uncomfortable wearing even short sleeves, let alone showing off my back. \n\nI've been talking to someone recently, and they are an extremely straightforward person, which I actually like. They noticed my back hair and pointed it out. Later on, they expressed to me that they did not like it as they didn't have that much themselves, and asked me if I was going to get it lasered in the future (respectfully, ofc, but it still shocked me a bit).\n\nThey started asking me about waxing as well, which honestly made me sad. They kind of implied that the back hair was a deal breaker to them, but didn't seem to mind the previous arm and slight stomach hair when they noticed it. \n\nI don't like my body hair, and I did plan to get it lasered or something in the future, or at least wax regularly, but I've always wanted someone who would accept me fully, body hair included. It makes me feel bad and insecure knowing that someone I like would like me a little less or maybe even leave me just because I have back hair. \n\nI keep thinking about circumstances where I can't get waxed or shaved often, or the fact that those things take up hours of my day when I decide to do it.\n\nMy dilemma is that I've always wanted someone who'd accept me fully, but I don't know if that matters cause I was planning on getting rid of it in the future anyways.  \n\n I don't know whether or not I should leave if they do think its a deal breaker (Im planning to ask), or if I should just suck it up and get rid of the hair because I was going to do it anyways.",

      "content": "My mom cheated on my dad two years ago and it still eats me alive. I feel like i should have moved on from this, but for some reason i still think about it at least once a week. For context, I (15F) found my mom cheating on my dad over two years ago. I was around 13 years old. I was setting up my new phone that i got early for my birthday when I saw my mom on safari, and the Tinder logo was right in the center of the screen. I watched over her shoulder a while longer and noticed her scroll through chats with other men. I felt sick to my stomach, i wanted to cry right then and there. I held my thoughts in and looked away, already calculating in my head. Later, my mom gave me her phone to call my grandmother. She went to another room, and as I was talking to my grandmother, i went through her search history and found Tinder in there multiple times. I clicked on the link and couldn’t even scroll through any of the chats because it made me so sick even to look. I remember the top chat was from a guy named Richard. My mom and him were exchanging messages that my brain has blocked out, but his black and white profile picture of a lion is burned into the back of my mind.\n\nAbout a day later, i told my dad what i saw. I was breaking down as i said it, i could hardly get the words out. My dad comforted me, but i could tell he was just staying strong for me. We watched part of a movie before i told him I was going to bed. He wished me good night, but he didn’t sleep in bed with my mother that night.\n\nThe next morning, i woke up to my mom in my room with a sad and frustrated expression on her face. she asked me why i had told my dad what i saw and why i didn’t come to her first. I just said i didn’t know i was supposed to tell her. She started to cry and told me that my dad had just been distant (busy with work) recently, that she needed love, and she wanted to feel beautiful again. I comforted her in the moment, but looking back, i can’t tell if that was manipulation. I’ve never been married, but cheating is never what it should come to.\n\nI went downstairs after a while, and everything was just.. normal? my dad was working on his computer seated at the kitchen table, my mom was doing laundry. i tried to apologize to my dad, thinking i had made a big deal over nothing. the world didn’t end, they didn’t get divorced, but i’ve noticed my parents act differently. my dad always tries to please my mom but she’s always annoyed or snappy when he has a question she thinks he should know the answer to or when something doesn’t go how she wants it to. it’s a tense environment around 70% of the time. i was talking with a friend about this a while back, but it just occurred to me to add this. my dinners and other events with just me and my family are dead silent 80% of the time, especially dinners. my friend said it was so weird and awkward how it was so silent while she was eating with us one time, but i’ve never known it as weird, it’s always happened in my household. Maybe it’s always been a tense environment and i’ve never noticed. My mom and dad are both teachers, my mom works with elementary kids while my dad works with college students. my dad works more than my mom, often working in the evening when he’s home or late into the night. my mom works a bit less, but she’s tired and stretched thin 24/7. Sometimes i wonder if they want to get divorced but can’t because of financial reasons or they don’t want to put stress on me.\n\nI’m not being abused or anything; I’m fed, my parents love me, but this has been eating at me for over two years. Even if this gets no comments or upvotes, it’ll be good to get it off my chest. I've been thinking about this a lot more recently, and it's affecting my mood towards my mother. I'll be fine and happy at school, but around her, it's hard to look her in the face knowing what she did. How can I get this burden off my shoulders? Should I talk to them? Should I talk to my dad or my mom separately? It's been eating at me forever. I need advice.\n\nThanks to whoever decides to read this long thing, lol.",

      "content": "How do I explain to my son that my husband and I are okay with him being gay when we don’t know for sure if he’s accepted himself?. Link to 1st Update:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1mfuwr4/update_how_do_i_explain_to_my_son_that_my_husband/\n\nHello all. Just to be clear, my husband (50M) and I (47F) are not homophobic in any way, we’re simply unsure of the correct away to approach our son about this.\n\nThis all started a year ago when my now 15 son had just turned 14. It was summertime and my son was enrolled in a lacrosse camp. One day he comes back from camp and tells me he met a boy from another team named Marcus (fake name). My husband and I are excited to hear that he’s making friends. I suggest that he should invite Marcus over one day. My son seems happy to hear this and they start to hang out a lot over the summer. Now we’re about a month into the summer and I’m cleaning out my son’s room while he’s at camp and I noticed that his computer is open and unlocked on his desk. I try my best not to be a snoopy mother, but since it was just sitting there, I thought I might just take a look and make sure he’s being safe. We had just recently given him some social apps, such as Pinterest, Instagram, and Snapchat. I just wanted to check to make sure he wasn’t doing anything that could be possibly dangerous.\n\nThe first thing I see when I open up Safari is three tabs. One is to an article about a bunch of pride flags, one is to a quiz to determine your “gaydar” (still not sure what that is), and  the third is a YouTube video about some Youtubers journey coming out out of the closet. At first, I was pretty confused and unsure what this meant. I called my husband into the room and showed him the tabs. He just sighed and brushed it off. My husband then explained to me that he did the same thing when he was a boy. It seems that many teenagers will experiment around this age to try and figure out things about themselves. So both of us just brushed it off as normal teenage behavior.\n\nWell, next thing we know, Marcus and my son are hanging out almost every other day. If they’re not hanging out together, they’re texting or calling. I mentioned to my husband that I feel like our son and Marcus have grown very close in a short period of time. He agrees with me, but also notes that it’s perfectly healthy and they’re both good kids so we should give them time to hang out and have fun. I 100% agree with this, but I’ve always been a bit protective of my son and I just want to make sure that he and Marcus aren’t going to have a bad fallout that leaves him super upset.\n\nSo both of us are giving them space to hang out and have fun this summer. But I’m making sure to keep a bit of an eye on them. The first time I noticed that my son and Marcus may be dating was when I came downstairs into our kitchen one night when they were having a sleepover to find them cuddling on the couch. Marcus had his head on my son’s chest, and my son had his legs wrapped around Marcus’s torso. This wasn’t just some kind of position where It might’ve looked like they were sitting close to each other. They were very obviously cuddling and even holding hands.\n\nI quietly return to my room and explain to my husband what I saw. My husband agreed with me and noticed that our son and Marcus had been getting very close lately. Neither of us were very surprised to find this as we kind of expected it. We decided to let it play out quietly and see if they would come to us first. We had no clue how long they had been hiding this relationship or if they were even officially dating yet.\n\nNow they are both 15 and it’s been about a year since they met each other. They still haven’t come to us to talk and I don’t know Marcus‘s parents stance on this topic so I don’t want to bring it up to them and potentially cause Marcus any trouble at home. Now my husband and I are pretty sure they’re dating as we’ve seen them cuddling multiple times and even caught them kissing once when they thought they weren’t being watched. Neither my husband or I are opposed to our son being gay or to our son having a boyfriend/girlfriend, but I’d really like him to come to us and tell us first. \n\nEven if I have to go to them and talk privately with Marcus and my son. I’d rather do that sooner than later and have this conversation with them so they can understand we accept and love them. I also feel like we’re introducing on their privacy and they would have more freedom and privacy if they could tell us. Any advice would help, thank you!",

Basically I went on my boyfriend’s phone to shut off an alarm because we both have the day off. I then get on to safari for a reason I’m not even sure and find a happy ending massage place that he had looked up and immediately my heart dropped. I then go into his maps obviously and find massage places but not the one he looked up. I then go into his deleted pictures to see if he made an appointment or I don’t even know what I’m looking for at this point. But I find a picture of a naked girl and text messages exchanging information for what looked like to be a sex worker (she asked if he was a cop and there was talk about money) but the messages stop after that. So I confront him about it and he says he didn’t actually do anything but he did look into it bc he’s “sick”. Basically he said he does it not for the actual meeting up but just because he’s curious. LISTEN I  KNOW. But I’m having a really hard time deciding where to even start thinking about this. I immediately told him to get therapy if it’s for everything he said and not just to cheat on his pregnant girlfriend. Which he has already started the process of. So do I try and work this out with him because I’m pregnant and he didn’t actually do anything. Or do I just move back in with my mom and say we can figure out co parenting. I’m having a really hard time figuring out how bad this is and I also have a lengthy history of taking people back when I shouldn’t. I’m trying really hard to respect myself and do what I think is best for me and my baby. He does seem extremely remorseful and I truly never thought he would ever do something like that to me.

      "content": "I’m having urges to torture and kill animals and I’m starting to want to do the same to humans.. Just wanted to start off by saying I’m 13. So, I got my first iPod when I was in third grade. And I was watching a bunch of videos on YouTube/safari. I came across this one video of a man getting dragged into the woods and shot in the stomach and he got split into pieces. I was completely disgusted. A few years later probably around 5th grade I saw a video of someone getting raped. And I ended up liking it. From there on I liked pretty much liked the concept of rape. But I didn't know how to get rape porn so I just watched a lot of hardcore porn. Same with 6th grade. Now here comes 7th grade. I'm home school and I don't get ANY social interaction. All I do is sit down and play video games and watch YouTube. It's all I pretty much know and it's super comfortable. I always have good memories playing video games. I have been playing video games sense I was 2 years old and Ive loved them ever sense. And 7 months go by and I haven't talked to a single person. The last time I talked to someone was November 14 on his birthday party. But anyway I go and I hang out with friends. And they notice I'm super antisocial. They even start commenting on. I barely talked. I don’t know if this matters but we went to 7/11 and bought an apple. Then we cut a hole to the middle and put the other side and put weed on the top and smoked. That was my first time.when I was hanging out with them. And everything I said was super awkward. (This was around 7 months ago)After that I remember finding another rape video. And I really like it. So I found more and more and more and more and more. Then I saw some videos that had a lot of blood in them. One was a video of a kid who was shot in the jaw with a sniper in Iraq and he was still alive. But he was doing a kind of screaming but whining thing because he couldn't talk. I also saw some other videos of people getting there head crushed by cars who people getting raped and murdered.i also saw a video of a baby getting run over by a train. And I once saw another video of a Mexican max getting all his limbs cut off. He was still alive until they cut his head off. I started liking all the stuff. Even the videos about torturing animals. In the end of 7th grade I got to the point where I would talk to myself. Now when people talk to themselves it's not like they see things. But they get there imagination mixed up with reality. Like I'll be thinking I'm in front of a crowd of people when in reality I'll be in my room alone and I'll start to think that's real life. And let's say someone in my head is talking to me I'll talk to them, but out loud because if I don’t talk to them I’ll think they’ll get mad at me and I don’t want to be rude. So there will be times I have my eyes open and I'll be talking to someone who isn't there. Another thing is that I'll be going to the bathroom and I'll be scared to go because I think I'll be in a public place when In reality I'm not. And I'll keep telling myself this and I know I'm not in a public place it's just something in my body tells me I am. In 7th grade my day consisted of playing video games for about 12 hours a day. One time I was at my cousins house and I saw they have some bunny’s. I had the urge to hurt them. So I picked up the bunnys and I was throwing them and stuff and I was shaking there cage. I was shaking at that moment with adrenaline. I wanted to punch torture them and hear them suffer but I just know it's not the right thing.  And I'm totally enjoying it. But I can't help it. I'll also pace around the room playing with my fingers and twitching. Currently in 8th grade things have stayed the same. I have bunnies that roam around in my field and I just want to put them in a sock and hit them agents a tree. And then put them in water for a few seconds and drown them but not long enough to die. Then just keep doing that. Or pour gasoline on it then burn it. But I know I shouldn’t do it. At school some people call me a tweaked because my eyes twitch. It’s like I’m in complete control over twitching my eyes.im just calling it twitching because i don’t know what else to call it. My eyes only twitch without my complete control when I’m tired. I told my mom and she said it’s Normal. It just feels so satisfying every time I twitch my eye. I keeps me calm. And if I don’t twitch my eye I feel like I have a lot of anxiety. For example: lay your arm flat and don’t move it no matter what. But try to send a signal to your arm telling it to move but like I said just don’t move it. You see what I mean? It gets really frustrating when you can’t do it . If You don’t believe me I can link you some of those videos of rape and people being murder for extra proof. And should I tell my parents? Because they would be disgusted. I mean my mom gets mad at me for saying “shit”. She’s really super nice and sweet. I mean she cried when she saw a homeless dude. Also, How should I tell my parents if you think I should.  (sorry for bad grammar)",

      "content": "Found my boyfriend's OnlyFans. To start off, I (24F) have known my boyfriend (27M) for awhile, we started off just hooking up as he was very clear he wasn't the dating type and then about 4 months ago things got very serious between us.  We started a real relationship and he has been the best partner to me. I've been in crappy past relationships and he knows all about them and was even my friend during my last toxic, narcissistic relationship.  So he knows I have been done wrong and hurt and cheated on.\n\nWe are very open and honest with each other and our feelings on porn.  He has always been a \"porn\" guy that likes to watch porn and jerk off and its just been a part of his daily life as he has been single for all his 27 years (I am his first actual girlfriend).  I have always known that about him and he's quite simply, a regular guy that likes to watch porn. I have never judged or faulted him for that and I do not have a problem with my partner watching regular porn because lets be honest, we all do.  \n\nHowever, we have had past conversations about how I am not comfortable with my partner paying for porn on cam girl or sights like OnlyFans as I feel like its too personal and crosses a different line than just watching free porn online.  I know he had an OnlyFans account but it said last used on March 8th (before we were together) and I have mentioned it to him and it has been a causal conversation about how he doesn't use it and I have believed him bc the activity status has never changed. \n\nWe kind of started living together over the last month, he told me to start moving my things from my apartment and I have stayed here every day / night...he got me Christmas gifts, takes me places, does all the regular wonderful relationship stuff...I have been hurt and cheated on and lied to before so I have a hard time trusting people, but I have genuinely trusted him and fallen into this relationship very easily.\n\nThis morning, I was rearranging the bedroom and he has a phone that sits on the nightstand he uses for crypto currency stuff, and I know he used to use it to watch porn, whatever, it's never been an issue and I have never questioned him. When I was dusting and moving everything around I was wiping off the dusty phone and it unlocked (no password on it) and the background apps that are still open came up and it was Safari with OnlyFans open...I know I should not have continued to look, I did not set out to open his phone, and once I saw it opened I should have closed it.  I know. But I think any person would see that on their partner's phone and feel obligated to investigate.  \n\nTurns out he has an account that is NOT the one I knew about, with a profile pic of his body and messages from I guess the accounts he subscribes too (I do not know how OnlyFans works, I'm assuming those are the people that message you? idk) But either way there were all pretty generic messages from the accounts \"Look at my new video\" etc. so on and so fourth, it upset me bc he obviously lied about having an account, but I figured it was old accounts because he was single forever so maybe they keep messaging all their subscribers, I really don't know.  But then I saw he responded to a couple of them since we have been dating, pretty stupid stuff like \"Keep up the good work\" or whatever, but on dates that we were together...I honestly was in such shock I cannot remember the details.  \n\nI do not know how to approach this, how do I bring it up? I was honestly and innocently organizing our bedroom...I did not intend to find or look for anything and I am afraid even mentioning it will start a fight about \"why don't you trust me why are you going through my stuff\"...what is a good way to approach this? Is it cheating? I feel very insecure and crappy about myself now and how can I get past my partner seeking out other women naked...is it just him being a guy?\n\nAnything helps, thank you.",

      "content": "I broke up with my girlfriend after 2 years together and now feel numb, guilty, and still attached.. Hi Reddit, I really need some outside perspective.\n\nI’m 19M and my ex is 18F. We were together for 2 years, starting in junior year of high school. She was my first love. My first everything. Earlier this year, I ended things after a long period of conflict, and I’m trying to understand if I have an avoidant or fearful-avoidant attachment style.\n\nSome context:\nA few months ago, she found a list of pornstars in my notes app, which led to a huge argument. To be honest, I had planned it in a way to “catch” her snooping because I suspected she was going through my private stuff. This was an issue in high school and the following years when I expressed to her I didn’t want her going through my phone. I had valuable information in there I didn’t want her to know, such as my personal journaling on my notes app and gifts I had planned to buy for her in my safari app. Along with personal and security reasons. But I was immature and decided to pull that move to catch her, but that also caused a huge argument.\n\nDuring that argument, I finally told her something I’d been hiding: I was SA’ed by another girl during my first week at college. I had gotten near-blackout drunk and couldn’t remember much of my night except little scenes, which included a girl SA’ing me on the dance floor, then me realizing what had happened as I was still nearing blacking out. Since then, I’ve struggled with shame, guilt, and feeling unworthy. I hadn’t gone to anyone about being SA’ed, so for the months before I ultimately told her, the shame and fault had tore me apart each day. I just felt so ashamed that it happened to me that I didn’t tell her the next morning. Even though I knew I should’ve told her as soon as possible.\n\nAfter telling her this, I told her I wasn’t good enough for her and that she deserved better. I basically tore myself down, almost like I was trying to push her away to make it easier for her to leave me. She tried to reason, but I told her straight up that I point-blank cheated on her, that I was not worth her love, and I was a monster and manipulated her. All attempts to push her away and make it easier for her to leave me. As I was afraid to pull the trigger of breaking up.\n\nInstead, we went on a break for about 4–5 weeks. During that time, we still texted here and there, but I felt numb. No relief, no sadness, no anger—just nothing. When she asked if I ever cried about us, I told her the truth: I thought about her, but I didn’t cry. I just felt empty.\n\nWe tried no contact. I broke it once when I found out she was going to a frat date party, because I got upset and texted her. But eventually, I gave all her gifts back (notes, stuffed animals, paintings) and blocked her everywhere so I could heal. I distracted myself from the thoughts of her by keeping myself busy with school and athletics. Then I finally felt a little relief, no more responsibilities and emotional attachments that were tied to my ex. After a while she posted a TikTok about letting go and no longer loving me, and coincidently two days later, I went to her dorm, said my final goodbyes, and gave her a note explaining why I ended things. That same day, I started seeing someone new. I was convinced I was over her, deleted everything and blocked her on everything to let a new door open while shutting the old door.\n\nNow I’m in a new relationship, but until recently i’ve been dreaming about my ex. Dreams where we’re yelling, crying, or trying to fix things. I wake up about to cry or feeling nothing. Then I get hit with a flood of emotions the following days. It was so bad that I couldn’t sleep some nights, often staying up until the morning. I told my current girlfriend about my situation and she understands how I am feeling and is willing to let me process these emotions.\n\nFor a while now i’ve had my ex blocked and no-contact was going fine. But recently I find myself checking her social media on a burner account. Even though I know I shouldn’t. I was doing just fine not checking it or being reminded of her for the past few months. But now I feel homesick for a home no longer mine. I still care for her, and I want her happy with or without me.\n\nFor background, I never really got love and care from my parents the way other kids did. I was never supported much growing up, and even now as i’m an adult I don’t speak to my parents at all, other than occasional small talk that is extremely awkward to hold. Could this be cause for avoidant-attachment or fearful-avoidance? I haven’t gone to therapy yet as I deemed it unnecessary.\n\nI just want some outside perspective on this.\nIs this an avoidant attachment pattern? Fearful-avoidant? Or something else?\nWhy do I feel numb and detached but still obsessively think about her?\nAm I hurting my current girlfriend by not fully letting go of my ex?\nHow do I start healing in a healthy way instead of trying to distract myself and stay busy?\n\nAny insight or similar experiences would help. Thanks for reading all this. I just want to understand myself better so I don’t keep repeating the same patterns. Thanks!",

      "content": "2 Days til Flight. Ok, let me set the scene for you. I was traveling abroad last year when I met a seemingly wonderful man during a group trip. I extended my trip and spent a week alone with him- traveling, exploring, having a magical time.\n\nWe’ve continued talking regularly. He frequently tells me I’m the love of his life, etc. naturally I’m a bit more guarded. Realistically, he’s halfway around the world but I enjoyed talking to him.\n\nI’m supposed to be flying back to his home country (Africa, for reference) in two days. He’d planned a 10 day safari for us, sent me the full itinerary. I’m stoked to going back to my favorite continent.\n\nLate last night, I receive a message stating that he can’t go in safari me. I’m confused but think there must be some reasonable explanation. I know he has a sick parent- perhaps they passed away? \n\nI’m standing at my bathroom sink when I hear the familiar ding from my phone. I glance down to see a message from this man’s wife- she’s included a wedding picture. Not only does this man have a whole wife but they also have 2 small children. Fuck.\n\nOk so here’s my dilemma. I have all my shots, I’ve taken the time off from work & my flight is non-refundable.\n\nDo I plan my own itinerary over the next 24 hours?? It would be my first time navigating a foreign county solo. \n\nShould I eat the cost or wing it alone?",

      "content": "I think my Dad is cheating on my Mom. Hi guys,\n\nA few months ago, I saw dating websites (sugar daddies ones) on my dad's iPhone in the section \"Frequently visited\" on safari. I saw that just before going abroad for a year (student exchange). I talked with him just before going because I felt it was going to be a pain keeping that for myself one entire year. He was very confused when I mentioned what I saw.\nHere is what he told me:\n\n*   \"thanks for telling me\"\n*  \"I visited these sites because I was curious\"\n*  \"I was curious because I heard about these sites at work\"\n*  \"I didn't meet anyone\"\n* \"I didn't like what I saw on these websites\"\n* \"Your mom doesn't know about that\"\n* \"Don't tell your mom\"\n\n**Here is the context:**\n\nMy dad works very hard in the capital city. On week ends he lives in the countryside with my mom and my little brother who is 10 years old (Me and my brother have the same parents). He works in the capital city from monday to thursday and goes back home on thursday night. I also have a sister who is two years younger than me, she's studying abroad too. My mom works too, she’s an artist. My dad’s family is catholic and has recently suffered from the divorce of my dad’s brother. My mom’s parents were very affected too by the divorces of my aunts. \nI already seen porn sites on my dad’s phone, he is very often on private navigation on his phone\n\n**Current situation:**\n\nIt felt great to talk with my dad before going, I was released even if I wasn’t sincerly convinced. Then, living abroad for the first time, I forgot a little bit about this story. It’s been 4 months I left my country now and I’m starting to think about it again. I told a few friends about this story (no one in my family though). I now think my dad lied to me. **My parents come to visit me in december for two weeks and I’m anxious about this.** I have never talked to my dad about that since I left. \n\n* Do you guys think I should try to know more about this story by talking with my dad? \n* Is it my business? \n* Should I wait the end of my studies (next summer)? \n* Do you think my dad definetly lied to me?\n* Do you think I should talk to my sister about this? \n\nThanks for reading and excuse my english ;)",

I had to a new create an account for this post as my fiancé is a big Reddit user but I’m desperate for advice!\n\nI [33F] think my fiancé [35M] maybe bisexual & I don’t know what to think or feel right nonetheless discuss it with him.\n\nI came home from work late tonight so when I got home, I see that my fiancé fell sleep on our bed with his laptop on my side... I got in bed and couldn’t go to sleep right away so decided to use his laptop for some online shopping. Well when I logged into it, I realize he left a safari window still open on the Reddit site. I noticed it wasn’t his accounts username (the only one I know of) so as I hate to admit, I snooped and saw that account was leaving sexual comments on bisexual and gay subreddits as well as sexual women one as well. \n\nI don’t have any issues with people who are bisexual or gay, shit some of my closest friends are gay but this I do have an issue with & in shock. My fiancé doesn’t even like ass play... If I even go near it with a finger during sex he freaks out and gets upset. I have an issue with this since he acts super homophobic, even seeing men kiss on TV.\n\nI don’t understand this and my anxiety right now is on high! Why is he leaving comments on bisexual and gay subreddits from a secret account when he acts so homophobic and doesn’t like ass play?!? This is so daunting on my mind and now I know I’m going to acting weird with him as soon as we start speaking in the am.\n\nI have no clue what to do... How to process this even. Especially how to bring this up to discuss because i feel like he’s going to get embarrassed and mad... I think it might be so bad how he got caught that he may even leave me. I don’t know, please help with some advice!",

      "content": "I feel like my friend group is dissolving and I don't know how to fix it.. So to preface this: I've known most of these people since middle school, I am a sophomore in college now so I've known most of the people in the group for over 8 years at this point, but with passing contact since I went to a different high school than them. After high school I started talking to a few of them more regularly and they invited me to join their friend discord server. I joined, then within a few months some massive drama happened which resulted in one member leaving (he had been antagonizing our other friend and when asked to stop repeatedly would feign innocence, or claim that he hadn't done it. I never experienced any of it, but was given a very detailed run down of everything leading up to that point). But after that we all agreed to talk more and try and figure things out before they become nuclear level events. \n\nOf course the road to hell is paved with good intentions, things got tense again between myself and my friend who I'll call Clara for the sake of anonymity. We talked it out, and the two of us were talking again. I won't lie I am a very loud person, I don't hide that fact and have made it very clear that I'm loud, and at times obnoxious without meaning to be. Roughly 2 months after I joined another member was added (a friend-of-a-friend type situation) who I'll call Luisa. She's very similar to me in that we are both really loud and will quote or repeat things we hear or watch to each other (echolalia go brrrr), well Clara and a few other friends didn't like this, and would constantly bag on us for being loud, to which we would tone it down considerably so. But anytime things get talked about in the group it always gets referenced back (like we were deciding on a new server theme since the safari theme we currently have has gotten old, and the idea of cats was suggested to which almost immediately a few of them went \"I hate it, because Venus and Luisa are just going to meow constantly\" which for a while was a common thing we would do back and forth, but when group members told us it was obnoxious we stopped.) Luisa and I are rather close despite only knowing each other for about a year now. And we talk often about some of the things happening within the group since more often than not it leads to us two feeling left out since the rest of the group (about 6-7 people) are much closer with each other than we are to them. (It's something that I'm working towards, but it's difficult with so much tensity in the group). \n\nRecently something happened to Luisa which caused her to be absent from calls for a few days (we typically would all be in call just about every night just talking and hanging out), then another member is visiting family and can't join calls at all since the reception where he's at is pretty bad (we'll call him Mark). Well Mark and Luisa were sorta the glue of the group if that makes any sense. Mark was the connector between me and the group since I was closest with him, Luisa was another connector as she always brings a sortof lightness to the group that we all need since we're a bunch of 20 something college kids trying to figure out life, and she's really good at being that sorta carefree bright friend who always knows the right things to say. But without either of them in calls things have felt tense. Nowadays only a few people join calls, and if the others do its for a few minutes before they leave to go do something else. \n\nI want to say something to the group about it, because it is affecting me, but I don't want it to seem like I'm pointing fingers or placing blame on anyone when I just want us to feel like friends again. But I don't know how to say that without potentially making someone feel like I'm blaming them, or rocking the boat. (the last time I said something that \"rocked the boat\" it almost lead to me leaving the server because it was made into a \"who's side are you on\" thing, and became something massive despite me trying to keep it small between myself and Clara. So I'm terrified of creating another situation like that). \n\nI don't want to leave the server and I know I'm not faultless with this situation, but it feels like the group is dissolving and I don't know what to do, or even if me doing anything would solve it. Any and all advice is appreciated.",

I 16yold female, saw a safari suggestion on my dad’s phone in october 24 and it was tinder, My brother came and approached my dad ab it but he shouted at him and told him he’s trying to ruin everything , From that moment i couldn’t help but observe my fathers behaviours, He works abroad. But i noticed that he bought himself a convertible, And has become more interested in gym/his looks, Which isn’t bad but , He had hid the car from family and i found out by choice, And also, In 2023, Me and my brother found out he had downloaded tinder and hinge and many dating apps, So i couldn’t help but think he was doing something, A fe days ago , My mother was complaining to me that she feels my dad has been distant from her, So i told her that when he came back from travelling there was a pink stain on his shirt, And she didn’t notice, I thought this would make her more aware, And that when she gets back she could see for herself, But yesterday, She saw the shirt and then instead got mad at me for even thinking that my dad could cheat or do something bad like that, But then i couldn’t stop myself and the words just came out as i was trying to defend myself and then told her that i only said it bc i saw my father on tinder again, It was heartbreaking to see her reaction , And then my brother revealed to her that he saw on my dads gmail a tinder subscription from 2020(tinder gold) and he told her that on my dads google maps , It said he was at a s**krip club, And obviously she was devasted . The next day i wake up and my dads screaming and shouting and he slaps my mum and tells her he wants a divorce , She is now heartbroken , But my dad said this in the midst of anger , After speaking to him he said he regrets what he did to her, Abd he swore on his dead dad he never opened tinder, And i had no evidence bc it was only on safari suggestions . But now my mum is no contact with my dad for a few days, He knows he’s messed up, And now my mum is starting to blame me for everything. I feel like i ruined everything , Bur i should have never been involved . from a young age i should have never been involved in their marriage , But they made it like this. I feel horrible as if i ruined their marriage and broke my mums heart. She now is starting to resent me , And so is my dad. What do i do??",

I was wondering why bc he has never done that and I looked at his history (in front of him) and saw he looked up someone’s onlyfans. Not only did he look the person up, but he made an account too. When I saw it, he denied it at first and I was like “I’m not stupid. The evidence is right here.” And then he finally admitted to it. He says it’s because we don’t have sex often and he was weak and was curious. He claims men are curious and he was curious about herand looked up her onlyfans. He has apologized many many times at this point and knows he did something wrong.\n\nI know he didn’t cheat but he still denied it and he knew he was wrong bc he deleted his tabs off safari. He knew he was wrong. He tried to deny it. We have had a few problems with intimacy but we got over it. I just don’t like that he lied about it. I am so hurt and upset because he has nudes of me on his phone and claims I am enough….yet I don’t feel like I am enough because he had to jerkoff to a strangers onlyfans and not the photos he has of me.

My father has invited me to come up with an idea for an interesting vacation with him, \"like maybe a safari or something, or, I dunno, the Mediterranean\".  \n\nThe trip would be next summer, and we could probably give it two weeks or so; he has the resources to make pretty much any experience happen in relatively upscale style.  \n\nI'm looking for suggestions from the Reddit community to help us decide where we should go, and why.     \n\nConditions for the \"ideal\" vacation: \n\n1.  It can't be somewhere we've gone before together.  Previous trips included a jaunt across Spain, the heart of Memphis, Nebraska (it was his 50th state; he needed it to complete the set), the California coastline, and Germany.   When I was a kid, he took the family to Israel/Egypt, Denmark, and Mexico; he's taken my wife and kids with us to Bermuda, Puerto Rico, and an Alaskan cruise.    \n\n2. My father has Parkinsons.  He can't stay out past, say, 10 most nights, and needs a few hours in the middle of each day to recharge.  I think he knows this is his last real opportunity to push ourselves, so he wants to go out with a bang.  \n\n3. We have a preference for relative luxury and low-energy yet high-intellectual impact activities, such as touring buildings or museums, local attractions and culture, or just exploring a city and its delights.  Driving is not a problem, as he's happy to let me drive.   Shared interests include folk and blues music, intellectual argument, social change, good food, and local history.

People on the streets were not-really-eager to help, to call the police - I have met two girls who have helped me to call them, but I got no help, they were spending hours asking me questions, documents and talking about nothing.\nI can’t express my feelings about the situation without feeling guilty for what happened, even though there is probably not much of the guilt from my side. How do I recover from what’s happened? I know it’s just a material thing, even though I have a very important for me personal diary disappear(it was on the phone), pictures and Safari tabs I was planning to flick through later. Anyway, it’s a very significant loss for me, in financial meaning as well.

The other day my boyfriend and I went somewhere and I ended up needing to use his phone for something ,so I asked for it  and he opened it to safari and in the search bar it had onlyfans. I didn’t know what to say so I just said “ um what is this “ and he told me he never uses safari , that if must be an old search. We’ve only been in a relationship for about a month and a half but talking for almost 4 months. Idk I guess I chose to give him the benefit of the doubt in that moment because I do know he doesn’t use safari as his main search engine so I just blew it off . But I was laying in bed last night thinking about it and I decided to look through his search history in safari just so see if it was old. I really honestly thought he was telling the truth. But he wasn’t, it wasn’t old the search was from the day before and I saw it directed him and asked for his drivers lisence and a picture so I’m pretty sure he has a subscription of some sort. I just don’t understand why he would lie. I’ve told him before how uncomfortable I am with that kind of stuff and honestly if he’s going to look at porn I’d much rather it just be randoms, not a woman he’s paying to see naked specifically. I wish I would’ve never looked, now I don’t know how to confront him about this .",

      "content": "Financially unstable boyfriend advice needed!. Buckle up Reddit! This might be a long one.\n\nTo preface this story, I (25f) caught my boyfriend (31m) with an OnlyFans account in March while I was on his DoorDash app ordering food at the same time he received an email notification from OF. I was upset because our sex life isn’t the greatest and I’ve felt rejected by him in the past. I explained to him that I wasn’t naive enough to believe that I would stop him from watching porn, but I draw the line with OnlyFans because why are you paying money for something you can get for free?? And he was “purchasing” (wording of his emails from OF) personalized content, which crosses boundary for me and I made that CRYSTAL clear . He originally lied, saying they were previous subscriptions that he hadn’t canceled. I pointed out that one of the emails from less than 10 days ago thanked him for his “new subscription,” and called him out for lying straight to my face. He understood, apologized, cried, etc and promised it wouldn’t happen again.\n\nFast forward 4 1/2 months and I’ve tried to trust him and trust that anything done in the “dark” will come to light (here we are!). Tonight we were deciding on dinner and looking through different recipes on his laptop. We decided on one, and he was asking me to clarify instructions throughout while he was in the kitchen. About midway through, I decided to briefly “check” on his new laptop’s activity. I went to the top of the browser, typed in “onl” (specifically only those 3 letters to see what would come up)  and the FIRST recommended search from the browser was “only fans login.” I already know there’s no way this is the “norm” and confirmed on my iPhone’s safari. When I typed “onl” on my own device, “only the brave,” “only murders in the building,” and “online safety act” were the first things to come up.\n\nI will tag on that he also quit his “stable” job at the beginning of April, and has been getting paid about $1000 every 3 or so weeks (we live in CA, rent is $2.1k/month, he has never helped with utilities/gas/wifi/insurance). Mind you this is post-me finding out about his original OnlyFans spending. He complained to me last week about being down to $3.00 in his bank account and not being able to buy groceries while I was on vacation. \n\nI already know this is nuts and he needs to be shown the door… but Reddit WTF?? At what point does it click in a 31yo’s head that this isn’t financially sane? \n\nTLDR: Financially unstable boyfriend continues to spend money on porn! :)",

      "content": "How do I fix my parents parenting with my kid sister?. I (28F) have a kid sister (8F), same parents. I lived with her for 7 years and recently moved to another state. I helped raise her. \n\nMy sister has an iPad addiction. She spends her time outside of school glued to her iPad, either playing roblox or watching YouTubers play roblox. \n\nLast year, I noticed she was being overprotective over the iPad and needed to delete tabs before I searched something. Quickly out she was looking up porn and she looked frightened. She had a panic attack crying and begged me not to tell my parents and told me she was embarrassed. I calmly told her she can’t watch that stuff and we had a brief sex talk. I told her to come to me if she had any questions. I monitored her browser history for a while. My brother and I caught her making searches again, but this time I learned she discovered incognito mode. I disabled safari completely. \n\nSeveral months later, my brother and I caught her making porn searches on YouTube. Apples kids restrictions is awful and didn’t work (literally their kids version is or was glitched at the time and did not work at all). I also discovered during this time she’s been chatting w strangers online on roblox. I restricted her roblox account to not allow chat and I deleted YouTube. \n\nI moved to another state and my sister in law caught her chatting with strangers and using safari again. I found out my parents gave in to letting her do all this because she throws tantrums. My parents say they need her to have an iPad other wise she won’t eat, attend her supplemental classes, and she starts screaming and hitting my mom. It’s frustrating. I know how awful and wrong this sounds and it makes me feel so defeated that I can’t physically be down there to discipline her myself. \n\nAfter doing some research, I decided to download Kidslox which monitors her web search and allows me to block stuff on the iPad. I thought this was working. I found out she’s been using my moms phone to watch unrestricted YouTube. I also found out that my dad gave her a desktop at home and she’s made multiple accounts and uses roblox on the desktop. The Kidslox app notified me she made a potentially inappropriate search today “roblox text to speech dirty”. It blocked the search for her but when I made the search, the videos I found on YouTube made my skin crawl. \n\nI’m angry and I just about had it. I want to accomplish the following:\n\n- treat her iPad addiction \n- Treat her roblox addiction\n- Teach her to respect my parents \n- Explain to my parents the dangers of roblox and talking to strangers online\n\nHere are my roadblocks:\n\n- my parents. My immigrant mom acts like she has no idea how technology works. My mom is lazy and doesn’t engage my sister in activities outside. She had my sister at 40 and always claims she’s too tired. My dad enables my sister and gives Her everything she wants. My parents blame each other when I confront them about giving in to my sisters demands. When I or my brother have tried to talk to my mom, she deflects or disassociates from the conversation. She makes excuses. \n- I live too far away from everyone and this is draining me. I want to move back down or have her live with me. \n- Gentle parenting and embarrassing her. I worry that my parents will helicopter parent the crap out of her after I tell them everything she’s been doing. \n\nI’d like help in how I can talk to my parents about this situation and how much I should share.\n\nI’d also like help in how to speak to my sister about this entire situation. Currently, she thinks I don’t know about her multiple roblox accounts.",

      "content": "I desperately need advice about my boyfriend and OF girls in his search history. So my boyfriend and I (both 18) have been dating for around a year now. Everything is perfect, we talk through any problems and always work things out. There have only really been a few issues in our relationship but we have always resolved them. I trust the man with my life, I always thought of him as the “best of men.” He cares for me in a way I have never been cared for. We have plans to move in together soon. We bring out the best in each other, and I was so convinced he was obsessed with me and had eyes for no other woman. \n\nUntil today. For context we’ve been in a long distance relationship where we are away from one another for two month long periods. He’s home currently and just got back about two weeks ago. About a month into our last period of physical distance, we started fighting more, and our e-relationship became significantly more sexual (embarrassing but I promise I’m not an incel) but I passed it off as a symptom of depression, heavy weed use, and missing one another and our distance. But when he got back to town, I could feel when I kissed him that he always wanted more. And I often gave in, not like I really minded, but you guys know how hard it is to stop the process of sex. He’s tried to have sex every single time we’ve hung out. He constantly makes dirty jokes. \n\nIt has always been a strict boundary in our relationship that we don’t look at anybody else. No porn, no checking other people out, no entertaining people. We have always thought it fair and have followed it. His social media has never been full of half naked women or any of that stuff. But today, I may have looked on his phone while he was sleeping (bad, I know) and I found OnlyFans links in his instagram visited links. I clicked on them, and you can’t really see anything upon initially visiting them, and he doesn’t seem to have an OF account, but one of the OF links was also in his Safari search history, saying it had been opened a week ago. \n\nMy heart dropped to my stomach because this man has always been so perfect to me. For a while, I thought he was almost womanlike because of how kind and caring he was. I talked to him about it, and he said his instagram is occasionally spammed with random OF girls and he doesn’t interact with them. He does, however, play a game with himself to guess if a girl does OnlyFans? We’ve talked about like the OnlyFans girl “look” before in conversation (like specific makeup, body type, nothing derogatory) but he said essentially when he sees a reel by a girl who has that OF “look,” he goes to check if he was right. He visits the links in their pages that don’t explicitly say OnlyFans, but are often an array of links, including OnlyFans. The problem with that is, his history shows he initially clicked on their OVERALL link page, and then clicked the OF link off that page. There’s also a link to some other girls porn site that isn’t OF. There’s also a link in his Safari search history, and the basic OnlyFans page in his Safari search history. He says they must’ve opened from Instagram but he genuinely does not know. He doesn’t have an account, his bank account, cashapp—everything’s clean. \n\nBut when I confronted him about it, and was visibly upset, he quickly became meaner and angrier when I didn’t initially believe him. He threatened to leave and break up with me, which he later apologized for, but the immediate anger response after not being initially trusted makes me feel as though he is lying. \n\nI love him more than anything, and I’ve trusted him more than anything, but I cannot be stupid and I refuse to believe him just because I want to. I was under the impression that I was going to spend the rest of my life with this man and I just don’t know what to think. Can someone please help me and tell me what to do?",

      "content": "I just found out my mums cheating on my dad what do I do now. I literally just found out and its 4am so sorry if this post doesnt make sense. So my mum f40 is cheating on my dad m48, I'm currently in secondary school and have very bad attendance to the point were the council and teachers in my area are constantly nagging me and my parents for me to go to school, meetings, group therapy things, all of that type of stuff. And If I'm honest with you it's stressing me and my parents out. But recently I've been getting better and I'm trying to fix it.\n\nAnyways my mums polish and my dad's British and I don't live near either sides of my family so I'm not close with any of them at all, and every family gathering I'm always treated as if I don't have feelings or as if I'm not even there. And I know once my parents die im gonna have none to very little contact with them.\n\nAnd now timeskip to earlier today around 11pm, I turned on my mums ipad to watch some YouTube in my bed and eat some food and just relax you know, I go on safari (basically google) and I see a few tabs i didnt open and one of them says 'best dating apps for the uk' my dad doesn't use this ipad at all and I don't have any siblings and I know for a FACT I didn't search this up... so it had to have been my mum. I dont want to overthink this, I mean my parents marriage has been great recently, they've been going on dates and watching movies and beening all lovely dovie. Timeskip to literally 40 minutes ago (3:59am) I text one my bestfriends, \"I think my mums cheating on my dad\" \"when I was texting my dad on my mums phone yesterday some weird man kept sending her weird notifications.\" Around 10 minutes later (4:10). I text her, \"she's asleep right now I'm gonna go take her phone and have a look\" 1 minute later \"SHES CHEATING ON HIM\" I go onto WhatsApp at first I see the man who was texting her yesterday, and now there's a another man, I didn't stroll done the contacts list I just clicked on the chat the man and my mum shared, it seemed normal at first but then I see paragraphs and many messages of dirtys texts, the man planning airbnbs, nudes, i took pictures of some of the messages so i had proof just i case i need to tell my dad. All of it. I got to about the messages from early February but stopped I put the phone down and just broke down,after a bit I calmed down and put the phone back next to my mum making sure there was no evidence I was on her phone.\n\nAnyways sorry this is so long but i don't know what to do, I don't wanna tell my dad because I'm already really stressed out and I don't want my parents to divorce, and even if they do they will probably still live tougher because moneys tight.. which will cause more tension, and I'm already the least favourite in both sides of the family and I don't wanna be even more hated because I recked my parents marriage so please help me.",

      "content": "Tired of finance lying to me about porn addiction , any advice ?.   So just for context , I’m 19 and he’s also 19. We met 4 years ago in school and we just had a baby last year in August. And he proposed to me in December. So to start off, I found stuff first on his insta. His algorithm changed from normal stuff to explicit women. I got suspicious and went on to Facebook and found him searching random people , and then found videos of women. I said something about it and he deleted it. Now let me just make it clear , I didn’t tell him to do that. He said he didn’t “know” how it got there.. I knew he was lying I just deeply care for him I want to make things work especially cause we have a daughter. \n  Anyways I left it alone. Now I noticed he was being weird with his phone a few months after that. So I went to look through his tik tok and again found more women he’s watching. I brought it up to him and told him how it’s disappointing to keep seeing that he can’t let this habit go. He keeps saying “I don’t have a habit” “I’m not watching that my phone accidentally clicks on- blah blah just IMAGINE the excuses. Then he deleted tik tok like he did with Facebook. Again I didn’t ask him to, it honestly makes me mad that he does that because I feel like he has no self control. Anyways I moved on from it. Next occurrence, I was using his phone to search up a place to eat. I go on safari, it’s on private. It was asking for Face ID, and I told him hey open the tab please. He opens it and I guess he forgot he had porn on there cause that’s what opened up , xxx videos and he yanked the phone and deleted not just one tab but TABS. He had it tilted away so I couldn’t see anything. I didn’t know I could’ve just opened it with his passcode either, I just found out i could have done that and I wish I would’ve known to really see if he’s lying again. He said he didn’t watch anything and he felt nasty being on it. That he just left the site after it loaded. \n  I honestly don’t know what to believe anymore. I left it alone I was disgusted already. After that I went way back to see if he was doing this since the start. He sure was. He was watching women since I was 5 months postpartum is what I’ve found out , and I don’t know how to feel about it and how to deal with it in a healthy way for my daughter. I do everything for this man I cook I clean , I do little things like clean his car, I’ve helped him get a car , get a job when we were dead broke,we grew up overnight tg and I’ve helped him with so much and it feels like such a betrayal. \n  I try to do things as a family for my baby girl and we always end up arguing, he gets tense if my daughter starts throwing a tantrum and I’m so used to it I just block it out. Idk it seems like he only enjoys me if we’re baby free and that sucks. I don’t work , he’s the breadwinner but it’s because I just finished school and I just dropped everything to raise my daughter, we decided that’s what would work for now. We live with my parents at the moment and I haven’t told anybody about this. It’s hard too because my family adores him and he’s an amazing dad regardless , he shows up and works for his daughter morning to night and I respect him for that. I just don’t feel appreciated. We stay with my parents, and it’s hard sleeping in the same bed while dealing with this. I wake up so heavy hearted. He tries to touch me but it’s hard to be intimate with him. All I can see and think of are the things I found on his phone. \n  I’ve been loyal to this man since I was 16 , I’m about to turn 20 this year. I’m scared I’m going to waste my life trying to save this for my daughters sake. I want to be happy but I don’t want to ruin my daughter’s relationship with her dad or stress myself out more by separating.",

      "content": "Is this emotional abuse?. I've (15F) always had a pretty rocky relationship with my dad, and due to the coronavirus/being stuck together in a house for the past couple months we've been fighting way more than usual. We had a particularly nasty one today, and as a result I've been reflecting a lot on the way he's treated me. I may be a bit biased, but in no particular order, here are some things he's said/threatened to me.\n\n\\-On multiple occasions, he's threatened to set up my younger siblings for adoption as punishment for something I've done. (Maybe a joke? This happened when I was like 8-10 and actually thought he'd do it)\n\n\\-told me I'm the reason our family has been falling apart when he's mad\n\n\\-threatened to divorce my mother because of me\n\n\\-also told me I'm the reason why he will divorce my mother (again, when I was like 10 or something and didn't really get what was going on with their relationship)\n\n\\-told me I've been faking my anxiety attacks (I might be, but I don't really think I have been faking them. I know what the symptoms are but am not allowed to get a therapist or to seek a diagnosis because I'm \"faking\" it)\n\n\\-He's put time limits (through a IOS feature) on all my social media (20 minutes on safari/messages/insta/snap/facetime etc.)  and has threatened to run over my phone/ destroy it whenever we argue. (he's already destroyed my 11 year old brothers phone)\n\n\\-also limited my calling time on my phone so all voice/facetime calls are turned off from 10:30 p.m. to 8:30 a.m. (I get this as I have to sleep, but it's frustrating sometimes when I really need to just talk to someone and I can't; especially since the past couple months I haven't been out once) (I'm not allowed out at all because of the virus and haven't seen any of my friends) I guess I kind of deserve this one because I abused his trust by calling people too late.\n\n\\-told me my self harm was attention seeking because I've only cut myself a couple times. (this one might be true? I only really self harm after we fight so maybe I was trying to prove something or get back at him?)\n\n\\-Doesn't believe me when I try to explain my actions to him anymore because I lied to him once about how much time I was spending on my phone. I had found a way to bypass the time restrictions once and didn't tell him. Now, whenever he finds out I'm doing something he doesn't agree with and I argue with him he pulls the \"I know you lie a lot\" card. I do think I may be a pathological liar and also want to go to a therapist to get help for that, but again, I'm not allowed to.\n\nBig disclaimer!! I'm a healthy 15 year old who has hobbies and friends and exercises/plays a sport. I haven't been that suicidal/depressed and all that in a year, which I'm proud of. However, I know some people who have the same issues as I have with their parents as well, and was simply wondering if this categorizes as some form of abuse or if all parent children relationships have their low points .

Long story short, the agent changed one of our hotels from a 4 star to a 3 star hotel, with a price difference of $1500, and he isn’t changing the hotel back (saying now it is fully booked which we confirmed with the 4 star hotel that it is), or giving us the difference in price back. To add context, our driver is sympathetic and even arguing with his boss (in English and on loudspeaker as a group) to try and help us fix the situation. He is a very passionate guy and a great guide (he is in the process of getting licensing for his own agency and leaving this company), so I don’t want to do anything to the driver. \n\nWhat can I do as I am not in the position of power after sending the remaining money. I am thinking about giving a bad reviews and reporting to the Kenyan government travel department. Any other suggestions?",

      "content": "How to deal with rude neighbours without escalating. Hello, long time lurker first time poster, apologies for the formatting I’m on mobile. I just moved into a new apartment, and while it has tenant parking there isn’t assigned parking spots, there are 6 spots, 5 are useable as one is blocked by the dumpster, the other option is to pay for city parking. I am currently parking there as I have not had time to get a city parking permit as I have just moved in. Today, after I came back from running an errand with my roommate (we took her car) I found a fake parking ticket on my windshield. It says this, word for word:\n“PARKING VIOLATION. This is not a ticket, but if it were within my power, you would receive two. Because of your Bill Headed, inconsiderate, feeble attempt at parking, you have taken enough space for a 20 mule team, 2 elephants, 1 goat and a safari of pygmies from the African interior. The reason for giving you this is so that in the future you may think of someone else, other than yourself. Besides I don’t like domineering, egotistical or simple minded drivers and you probably fit into one of these categories. I sign off wishing you an early transmission failure (on the expressway at about 4:30 p.m.). Also may the Fleas of a thousand camels infest your armpits.”\nNow, if I had been parked badly I would understand, however my car was straight and completely in the spot, lined up with the cement marker. Another thing to note is that of the 5 available spaces, only 4 are being used. After finding this, I went and bought a dash cam and am planning on telling the building manager if something like this happens again, but I am wondering if I should do anything else or if anyone has any ideas why this may have been on my windshield to begin with? I have the “ticket”, a picture of the “ticket” and a video of my park job and will hopefully have time to get a city parking permit soon.\n\nEdit: spelling.",

      "content": "My boyfriend watches porn & I don’t like it, what can I actually do to get him to stop?. ** edited to add TLDR\n\nTLDR: My boyfriend watches porn, I don’t like it, I would like him to stop. I want him to feel bad when he go to watch it so that he ends up closing the tab or never opening one at all. He would feel enraged at the idea of me getting myself off to videos of other men. I would send him pics/vids every time he wants to watch porn if that meant he would stop entirely. For men, what things could your girlfriend do to actually get you to stop?\n\nThrowaway bc he’s on reddit.\n\nI (23F) looked through my boyfriend’s (25M) phone last night. I wasn’t planning on it but he fell asleep and I picked up his phone to turn his alarms on and plug it in to charge. He left his safari tab open and then I started looking through other things. \n\nWe’ve had a conversation about porn once before and I told him that I wasn’t going to make him stop watching it all together, but that I did have some specific boundaries in regards to it. It would cross a line for me if he was watching cam girls/OF, paying for any porn, interacting/messaging/liking/commenting with any porn accounts, saving/downloading any of it, or becoming obsessed with a specific person. \n\nBasically, if he opens a tab to watch free porn, has zero interaction, then closes the tab, it’s mostly fine to me as long as he also isn’t choosing porn over me or watching so much that it starts to become an addiction issue. I don’t like that he watches porn at all, but those were my specific hard no’s. \n\nLast time we had this conversation, I told him how it made me feel emotionally and that the idea of him watching other women to get off made me feel bad about myself. He told me that the majority of the time, he just looks at videos/pictures of mine/ours, but that it wasn’t a big deal for him to stop watching porn all together. I’ve gone through his phone one other time after this convo and found porn so this is the second time now showing that he didn’t actually stop watching it. \n\nI’m not necessarily mad at him, especially because when we first started dating, I was still watching porn. But I stopped entirely pretty early on in our relationship because it made me uncomfortable getting off to other men. It made me feel guilty and it felt like I was disrespecting him or almost even cheating on him. \n\nHonestly I really just want to subtly bring up the porn topic and ask if he still watches it. Hoping he’s truthful about it, but I want to reframe his perspective on it. I know for a FACT that he would feel internal rage at the idea of me getting off to other men. He is so protective and almost possessive of me (this isn’t an issue in our relationship btw) that it would infuriate him. Not AT me, but just the idea of it would make him feel very jealous and upset.\n\nIf I bring up the topic in a casual way, I think I’m gonna mention to him that I used to watch porn, but stopped in the beginning of our relationship because it felt disrespectful to him and then also bring up that for him to understand how I feel about it, I want him to imagine me touching myself to videos of other men. If I phrase it this way, I’m wondering if something will click in his head and make him feel bad every time he goes to watch porn, and then I’m hoping it brings his usage down or stops it entirely. \n\nI’m also willing to make him a deal and send him pics/vids every time he has the urge to watch porn. Every. Single. Time. Genuinely. I don’t care if i’m at work, with my family, grocery shopping, if he’s at home and wants to watch porn, I would much rather send him my stuff each time than for him to go get off to other women. For any men here, if your girlfriend did that for you, would it get you to stop? If not, what would it take for you to stop, that would actually be possible for her/both of yall to do?",

One night it was around 1 AM and I was on my phone and I formatted my screen to go between apps, and at the bottom it said my dad was on safari. Out of curiosity I hit the button and to my horror found he was on some porn twitter account. Since then I have noticed he goes to the bathroom for long amounts of time and I see he is on safari. I’ve hit the thing to see it multiple times and every time its some porn twitter account. This just happened tonight and it’s getting me angrier and angrier, mainly for my mom. Is there anything I can do about this?",

I tried taping the screen but it did nothing, I went to press my home button and it wasn’t working. Even the power button didn’t work. after a few minutes of that my screen went black and the apple logo came up.

About a week afterwards I was on a tab and it suddenly closed itself while I was looking at it.\nDo I have a virus? If so, what should I do?",

Its already been out for about 3 years so I'm not sure if it will last me for at least 4 years. I will be mainly using the iPad for taking notes/doing hw for university and browsing social media and safari. I think I might do some multitasking while using safari too.\n\nShould I get the iPad Air 5 or will the iPad Air 4 be good?\n\nNote: I don't want the iPad gen 9",

However a few days later I can barely lift my right arm.. the leg pain is dissipated but a bit concerned about the soreness. \nI have soaked in hot tub and iced it.. I am trying to wait until I get back to the states.\nHas anyone ever fell off these vehicles  and did the soreness go away.\nNote: I understand this is just general advice and that most likely if this continues, seeking medical care will be my only alternative. Just trying to soothe my anxiety in the meantime.\n\nEDIT: I was in so much pain last night, I called a doctor. The pain in my shoulder is worse with certain movements. My arm is also weak.They gave me an IV cocktail of anti-inflammatory meds/vitamins/pain meds. They also cheduled an xray to rule out fractures. The medication took the edge off very slightly so thats a worry point for me. Like maybe its a fracture 🤔..anyway I find out today.

It's well faded from its original coloring, outside of some critter damage to the waist pocket, it's in fantastic shape. Originally purchased to carry my skateboard and bring with me while snowboarding... It's transcended use cases as my life has changed.\n\nIt became a diaper bag when my kids were young, my go to picnic bag. It's been with me through back country snowboarding, multiple national parks hikes, a two week long safari, a dozen countries, a couple hundred miles a week of motorcycle rides and just refuses to quit.\n\nWhen something *inevitably, eventually, maybe* actually wears out on it, I'll absolutely be buying another in hopes I get the same usage out of it.",

      "content": "Review: durable laptop/messenger bags <$400. Hello,\n\nI'm looking for a briefcase-laptop-messager bag, as BI4L as is possible within budget, $200-$400. \n\n## Motivation\n\n[Saddleback leather](http://www.saddlebackleather.com) came up frequenty in older posts on this, but their prices have  more than doubled to the $800-$1000 range. Other affordable brands that have been suggested in the past have raised their prices or are unavailable, so the information on this sub is not completely current. In particular, I found no current post that collected information for my requirements. I've gone through the sub history and compiled the relevant information in case someone else runs into the same problem I did.\n\n## Goal: \n\nI'm looking for something simple and professional. Minimalist and masculine. I hope to avoid prominent logos, and dislike the extreme outdoorsy designs like Saddleback. It's for business, but not the kind of business where expensive things are used as credentials. Simple, utilitarian, well made but not necessarily by hand or from rare materials. A timeless design for everyday use. I am looking for something with a leather finish or accents, but that uses more common materials structurally and for the lining. No need for all natural.\n\n## Compiling information from previous posts\n\n[Replies to this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/49uw0b/bifl_request_leather_messenger_baglaptop_bag/) state that no affordable well-made bags exist for my budget and aesthetic. And indeed, none of the suggested companies there suit. However! There is hope:\n\n[This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/log73/bi4l_request_leather_briefcaselaptop_bag/), with a similar price range, recommends [J.W. Hulme](http://www.jwhulmeco.com/briefcases-laptop-cases-s/112.htm), but their prices are also in the $800-$1000 range. [This bag, however, from Marco Poloni, at $340](http://www.marcopoloni.com/URBANO-zippered-messenger-bag.htm), is in budget. [Naragansett leathers](http://www.narragansettleathers.com/brief.html) is in semi-retirement with very low production volumes, so is not current.  \n\n[This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/21pnc5/bifl_best_casual_briefcasemessenger_bag/) has a similar budget, but is explicitly interested in the rugged look that I'm trying to avoid. However, I like [this copper river bag](http://www.copperriverbags.com/the-bolinas-17-rugged-brown-voyager-laptop-bag-made-in-the-u-s-a-17-v-br-lap/). [Leyden and sons](http://leydenandsons.com/ourbags/product-category/double-pocket-rugged-messenger-bag/) is on the higher end of the budget range, and also solidly in the rugged / outdoorsy camp, not right for me. (If you view Leyden and Sons website with Javascript blocked, you see that they are doing something underhanded for search-engine optimization, which makes me feel they are not trustworthy). The [safari](http://farhorizontraders.com/products/safari) bag from Far Horizon Traders is also good value, at $270 it is solidly in-budget.\n\n[This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/2b02ct/discussion_woodrough_leather_briefcase/) highlights the difficulty of identifying quality products in this price-range. The company in question, woodroughleather, has appropriately gone out of business. [Vagabond Traveler](http://www.vagabondtraveler.com/product/index.php?route=product/category&path=49) was recommended;\n\n[Here's another budget laptop/messenger bag post](https://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/3i3rso/bi4l_request_briefcasemessenger_bags/), with good links. [The Waterfield bags](https://www.sfbags.com/collections/shoulder-messenger-bags) are close to what I'm looking for. [Defy bags](https://defybags.com/collections/bags?page=4), [Filson](http://www.filson.com/briefcase-computer-bag.html), and [Zero Halliburton](http://zerohalliburton.com/work/laptop-tablet/), had good reviews from users, but weren't what I was looking for. In contrast, [Rugged matrial](https://www.ruggedmaterial.com/collections/all) and [Oak roads](https://www.oakroads.com/collections/briefcase-bags) are affordable, and I like the designs.\n\n[Another messanger-bag-on-student-budget post](https://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/3mi997/bifl_request_leather_bagbriefcase_that_is_durable/). Of the many excellent suggests, [Satchel & Page](http://www.satchel-page.com/collections/bags), [Gusti Leather](https://www.gusti-leather.co.uk/bags.html), and [Marlando](https://www.marlondoleather.com/collections/leather-briefcases) carry bags in the design I'm looking for. \n\n[This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/4y7cdz/bifl_request_casual_briefcase/) suggests [Highonleather](http://highonleather.com/collections/leather-messenger) is surprisingly cheap if they are really BI4L.\n\n## Summary\n\nMany affordable leather laptop/messenger bags have been recommended by BI4L users, that seem to compete with the higher priced brands. \n\n[Marco Poloni](http://www.marcopoloni.com/URBANO-zippered-messenger-bag.htm)\n - [Copper River](http://www.copperriverbags.com/the-bolinas-17-rugged-brown-voyager-laptop-bag-made-in-the-u-s-a-17-v-br-lap/)\n - [Far Horizon Traders](http://farhorizontraders.com/collections/cow-hide/products/serengeti)\n - [Vagabond Traveler](http://www.vagabondtraveler.com/product/index.php?route=product/product&path=49&product_id=1004&poip_ov=854)\n - [Waterfield](https://www.sfbags.com/collections/shoulder-messenger-bags/products/cargo-laptop-bag)\n - [Oak Roads](https://www.oakroads.com/collections/briefcase-bags)\n - [Rugged Material](https://www.ruggedmaterial.com/collections/all)\n - [Filson](http://www.filson.com/briefcase-computer-bag.html)\n - [Satchel and Page](http://www.satchel-page.com/collections/bags)\n - [Gusti Leather](https://www.gusti-leather.co.uk/bags.html)\n - [Marlando](https://www.marlondoleather.com/collections/leather-briefcases) - \n[High on Leather](http://highonleather.com/collections/leather-messenger)\n\nThe question is: what is the relative quality, value for each of these brands? For example, High-on-leather is cheap but has clearly fake reviews, which does not instill confidence. And I took Leyden and Sons off the list due to their weird search-engine optimization, but dubious advertising practices need not imply poor quality or value. \n\n## Shortlist\n\nSorted from least to most expensive\n\n[$66](https://www.gusti-leather.co.uk/bags/studio-sebastian-smart-business-satchel-2h36-26-1.html) - Gusti leather, price converted from pounds, does not state size\n\n[$88](https://www.gusti-leather.co.uk/bags/studio-mitch-smart-business-messenger-bag-2u4-17-1.html) - Gusti leather, price converted from pounds, 15\"\n\n[$98](https://www.gusti-leather.co.uk/bags/nature-alex-17-large-smart-satchel-u23.html) - Gusti leather, price converted from pounds, 16\"\n\n[$121](https://www.gusti-leather.co.uk/bags/studio-ned-large-smart-messenger-bag-2u42-17-7.html) - Gusti leather, price converted from pounds, 16\"\n\n[$143](https://www.gusti-leather.co.uk/bags/murray-leather-messenger-shoulder-bag-business-satchel-2u31-17-1.html) - Gusti leather, price converted from pounds, 16\"\n\n[$159](http://www.vagabondtraveler.com/product/index.php?route=product/product&product_id=1302) - Vagabond, on sale. 15\"\n\n$175 - Far Horizon's [Journeyer](http://farhorizontraders.com/collections/camel-leather/products/journeyer) and [Professor](http://farhorizontraders.com/collections/camel-leather/products/professor) bags, 16\"\n\n[$250](http://highonleather.com/collections/brown-leather-satchel-bag/products/saddleback-leather-briefcase) - High-on-Leather 16\" saddle bag; review looks fake?\n\n[$231](http://www.copperriverbags.com/copy-of-large-15-hemingway-briefcase-distressed-made-in-the-u-s-a-15-hem-dis-brc/) - Copper River Bag Co.'s \"Hemingway\" bags, 17'; +$58 ($288) with shoulder strap\n\n[$250](http://farhorizontraders.com/collections/cow-hide/products/sahara) - Far Horizon's Sahara bag; 16\", no laptop pocket.\n\n[$275](http://farhorizontraders.com/collections/cow-hide/products/safari) - Far Horizons Safari 16\", with laptop pocket.\n\n[$295](https://www.ruggedmaterial.com/products/classic-leather-messenger-bag-pullup-brown) - From Rugged Material, 16.5\"\n\n[$350](https://www.sfbags.com/collections/shoulder-messenger-bags/products/cargo-laptop-bag) - From waterfield bag, mix of synthetic; 16\"\n\n[$376](https://www.oakroads.com/collections/briefcase-bags/products/scully-leather-81st-aero-squadron-commodores-lambskin-briefing-case) - Oak Roads bag, 16.5\"\n\n[$379](https://www.sfbags.com/collections/shoulder-messenger-bags/products/rough-rider-messenger-bag) - Another waterfield bag; 16.5\", minimalist\n\n[$380](https://www.marlondoleather.com/collections/leather-briefcases/products/anglers-bag) - Marlando Angler's bag, 16\" \n\n[$388](https://www.oakroads.com/collections/briefcase-bags/products/jack-georges-voyager-brown-buffalo-leather-business-travel-bag) - Another Oak Roads bag; 15.5\"\n\n[$395](http://www.satchel-page.com/products/4-way-briefcase) - Satchel & Page 16.5\" briefcase, on sale now for \n\n[$435](http://www.satchel-page.com/products/mailbag) - Satchel & Page 16\" messenger bag, just  over-budget.\n\n## Questions\n\n1.

      "content": "Kelty Redwing 44 - 2016 Edition. My go anywhere, do anything pack.. I just came back from a climbing trip this morning and I was so impressed with this thing I had to tell someone.\n\nI bought this bag for my first international work abroad trip in Kenya. I was there for a month straight. It was my main luggage - I lived out of that pack for a month straight. Fit my work laptop plus accessories, clothes, food, other personal effects comfortably, solidly, without problem. I took it into the bush. Up country on \"safari\" with some friends who worked for the national park service in Kenya. We really roughed it out there. Again, fit everything I needed and then some and not a mark to show for being thrown about the back of an old restored British Colonial Land Rover from the 50s/60s (I'm not a car guy but it was old and angular in the back). I've made multiple trips out to Kenya and China since, with this bag serving as my luggage and field bag - a total of over 100 days as a professional and personal bag I sued in an office and way the fuck out in the field. I have never had a single reason to complain. \n\nSince then, I took up rock climbing. It has been my primary crag pack. Rope. Harness. Shoes. More shoes. Sport gear. Trad gear. Food. Water. First Aid. Maps/electronics. It carries everything. I've clipped it to a nut and slung it from a crack while me and my friends rooted around in there for gear or snacks. It slid down a chossy hill into a stump. It has been a bed for me one more than one occasion....No. Signs. Of. Wear. \n\nThis thing is just a bit dirty on the bottom, but nothing a bit of water cant clean up. No stitches out of place. No broken buckles. No frayed webbing. No discoloration. No compressed padding. This bag has done everything I have ever asked of it and it has done it with a smile on its face and spring in its step. This is the most comfortable bag I have ever worn while also carrying as little as 10lbs worth of office stuff up to ~50 lbs worth of camping/climbing gear. \n\nI have no idea if Kelty has made any meaningful changes to this pack since then, but I wish I had bought 4 just to ensure they keep making these things.\n\nI have no experience with anything else Kelty makes...if they made nothing else, I would be fine and we would consider ourselves lucky. I am a bit obsessed with backpacks and I have a lot of experience with many of the other relevant brands (REI, Osprey, Gregory, Northface before their mid capacity bags started sucking, MR, etc.) and though some of them have more modern features or are lighter or are better suited to some specific activities, This bag is my go to bag for everything unless I know I will need something with a lot more capacity, or if I need something tiny and lightweight. But for everything else, it is this bag.",

I wanted to share a AI tool I built to help sort through too many reviews when buying a product on Amazon. I'm constantly frustrated with having to sort through dozens, hundreds or thousands of Amazon reviews when I'm trying to make important purchase decisions *so I don't waste my money on the wrong thing* (this is happened to me so many times I've lost track of counting).\n\nTo solve this problem, I made a free extension for Chrome to automatically summarize reviews for any Amazon.com product.

Trust me, I've read every thread, and I'm feeling overwhelmed.\n\nI'm looking for an everyday laptop bag that will fit a 15\" laptop and a few other items, most notably a pair of over-the-ear headphones. I'd like a *separate* laptop compartment, not just a sleeve, as that's the situation I'm currently dealing with. My budget is somewhere under $400, and it's okay with me if \"BIFL\" means 10-20 years with proper care. As far as styles go, I've seen and liked these:\n\n - Scully Aero Squadron ($370) https://www.oakroads.com/collections/briefcase-bags/products/scully-leather-81st-aero-squadron-commodores-lambskin-briefing-case\n - Far Horizons Savanna ($250) https://farhorizontraders.com/collections/cow-hide/products/savanna\n - Waterfield Bolt Medium, Chocolate/Black ($259) https://www.sfbags.com/collections/briefcases/products/bolt-briefcase#parentHorizontalTab2\n - Knomo Kobe ($245) https://www.knomobags.com/usa/sale/kobe-15-leather-messenger-brown.html\n\nI'm leaning toward one of the two \"old\" style bags - the Scully or the Savanna. I'm concerned, though, about the durability of those two, particularly give the reviews for the Far Horizons Safari (https://farhorizontraders.com/collections/cow-hide/products/safari).\n\nThe bag that initially caught my eye was the Bolt, though it's got less... character than the first two. The Kobe is a cleaner alternative, and probably my least favorite. It's also the one that seems the most subject to manufacturing variance.\n\nAnyone have experience with any of these models? Durability? Customer service? Recommendations for others in the same style, within the same price range?\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nEDITED: to include specification for a separate laptop compartment.",

      "content": "[BIFL] Far Horizon Traders Safari Bag. Up front: The Safari bag is available at http://farhorizontraders.com/products/safari. FHT didn't give me anything to post here (this is my first review of any sort ever) but I just really appreciate this bag and thought others might as well. It seems the only FHT reviews are about the smell of the camel bags (which is a separate issue altogether) but this one is plain jane cow leather...\n\nOkay!\n\nThis is my first \"real\" bag. I've owned a couple LL Bean messenger bags and more recently a Timbuk2 Command messenger bag. I really liked the command - I thought it looked really sharp and had tons of pockets - but I wanted something leather that could hold a 15\" laptop and a bunch of books. Right now I work as a chemist, but I'll be starting law school soon, and I basically always have my laptop, iPad Pro 9.7\", my lunch, some notebooks for patent bar review, and a book I'm reading (currently The Colonel by Richard Norton Smith, cannot recommend enough!). But it's a lot of stuff, and this bag handles it all very well.\n\n---\nPhotos: http://imgur.com/a/CERxN\n\n---\nPros:\n\n* Lots of space. There are 3 internal sleeves (you can see I use them for pens, external HDDs, etc), 2 main interior pockets, one zippered pocket in the back of the interior, one external sleeve (my favorite part) and two enclosures on either side (I put my phone in one, and wallet and keys in the other).\n\n* Looks great. It's not a small bag, but it never looks massive, and I get a number of compliments on it, or questions as to where I bought it.\n\n* Durability. Sometimes I'm carrying quite a lot, and I've never once felt as if it's going to break in any way. A lot of people buy the cheap \"leather\" messenger bags on Amazon (though probably not on this sub!) and if you know about them, you know they snap, they rip, they break.... Not this guy.\n\n* The handle. This is a minor thing but wow... the handle just feels so sturdy, unlike anything I found from L.L. Bean or Timbuk2. I find myself carrying it that way just because I appreciate how well constructed it is.\nCustomer Service. Holy cow. Have you ever emailed Matt? If he doesn't respond within 15 minutes, it's probably because he's asleep. Insanely helpful guy, and a great reason to look into FHT.\n\n\nCons:\n\n* The rear laptop compartment fits a 15\" laptop with a hardshell case (I don't use one) but if you want to put a sleeve on the laptop, I don't think you'll be able to zipper it closed. Not the end of the world, but of note. I was worried that the zipper would scratch the laptop, but so far my 15\" Macbook Pro is clear of scratches.\n\n* The strap came too long for me (5'9\") even on the smallest settings. I used some tools in our chem lab and made two new holes, which make it perfect.\n\n* When the straps are undone, you can only pick it up by the shoulder strap, not the handle. I don't know how you get around that in engineering, but... it is a minor inconvenience.\n\n---\n\nOkay! So those are my thoughts. Feel free to ask any questions or send me photo requests. It's a fantastic bag, and I can't wait to test it out in law school. Now... back to work!\n\nThanks guys.",

One of the characters was carrying a Duluth Safari Duffel (mini or small, I cant tell), and its seems really cool. Duluth advertises the duffel as the ultimate basic travel duffel you can take anywhere, even on a safari etc. I have seen many companies offer canvas duffels with a similar purpose. Most of them are half as expensive as the Duluth Safari. My understanding is that Duluth is high quality but I have never owned their products and cannot confirm. Sadly there are no video reviews for this product on Youtube. Anyone know if this duffel is genuinely rugged enough to be worth $200+.",

My dad likes carrying things with him wherever he goes and almost always wears a vest to hold all of his stuff in.  I think he's had it since the 1980's or 1990's and it is finally starting to come apart in multiple places.  It has two giant pockets in front on the bottom, side hand pockets behind them, two slightly smaller pockets above them, and a few other pockets higher up and on the inside.  I'd like to buy him a new vest to replace it with, but it will need to be fairly durable.  I am looking for the same style, the material should be cotton, canvas, or some other durable fabric.  It does not need to be breathable, insulated, or waterproof, and it should have a very good zipper in front.  He likes having at least one zippered pocket, but that may not be a requirement.

The best I have been able to find is this one for $16.99:\n\n* [AmazonSmile: Sun Hat for Men Women, 6\" Brim Sun Protection Outdoor Bucket Cap, Unisex Beach Fishing Golf Safari Waterproof Breathable Packable Boonie Hat at Amazon Men’s Clothing store](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07P6HV43N/)\n\nIt's big enough, but I'm skeptical of the quality. I found the Tilley LTM2 for $80:\n\n* [AIRFLO® Hat | Tilley](https://www.tilley.com/us_en/ltm2-airflo-hat.html)\n\nIt advertises itself with this:\n\n> \"Serious about sun protection? Our broadest brim AIRFLO® Hat overshadows the rest…literally. \n\nWell, the brim is only 3.5 inches, which isn't any better than the cheap ones I normally can find anywhere in the world any time I want one. That's not going to work for someone who cares more about effectiveness than fashion. I'm considering getting 2 hats, if necessary:\n\n1. A hat with a wide brim around 4 to 5 inches when the sun is high and I want to avoid the stares from wearing a UFO at a shopping mall,\n2. A hat with a wide brim 6 or more inches when the sun is low and UFO's are already everywhere anyway. This is the hat I really want and prefer, more than the one above.\n\nIt must be foldable so I can pack the hats away when I'm not impersonating The Three Amigos. I dislike hats that fail to block the sun because they have holes in them for ventilation. I'm not completely bald, so it's not super critical, but effective sun blocking is much more important than ventilation. \n\nI prefer a neutral light gray color over other common colors like khaki or beige. I would consider darker colors like black or blue, but I prefer to avoid looking like I'm in the military or on a safari.\n\nIf it didn't need to be packable, I would consider all the enormous stiff hats that were designed in a time when people cared more about sun protection than beach selfies. I realize it's a challenge to make a big hat with a wide brim that doesn't flop down under their own weight like Dumbo ears, but I suppose that explains why modern gigantic synthetic hats don't weight 3 kilos anymore. That said, I could consider a hat made of non-synthetic materials that are still packable, like leather, especially if it's fashionable enough I won't want another smaller hat. \n\nI suppose if it's sufficiently fashionable such that I'm never afraid to wear it, it's less important for it to be packable, but it still needs to be able to survive getting brutally crushed in a bag, indelicately cleaned, etc, and I'm unlikely to select a hat that's fragile (like straw or felt). That's why I'm not using a sombrero or a Southeast Asian cone hat.\n\nThanks for the help reddit!\n\nEDIT:\n\nI found a hat somebody made for a Cad Bane costume, it would be nice if it were commercially available:\n\n* http://i34.tinypic.com/2i7tvo4.jpg\n* [Want to make a Cad Bane costume: where do I start? | Jedi Council Forums](https://boards.theforce.net/threads/want-to-make-a-cad-bane-costume-where-do-i-start.30289089/)",

Been wearing a pair of Romeos for a couple years now.\n\nPopov Leather - Made in Nelson, BC. have a few of their leather goods, holding up really well.\n\nMeyer - PEI. High quality made in Canada pots and pans, I have their non-stick 12”.",

I was fortunate enough to find it brand new at a second hand site called Poshmark … it was marked down to only ~$14 USD … such a good deal I bought the only 2 that were available one brown and one black, brand new in original packaging. I believe they were thrifted from a liquidation store and resold online. Has a couple card slots on each side and a cash pouch in the center … perfect design for a wallet imo. Unfortunately I think this model is discontinued as the only one I could find new from Herschel is canvas. Been thinking about posting this for a while as I’ve seen many posts looking for a BIFL wallet. I will probably have it repaired when the threads do eventually go, and I have a second one ready for when/if the leather eventually deteriorates.

The C3 is surprisingly durable; mine hasn’t had a single issue after months of daily use.\n\nUsing it regularly has made me more proactive about ear health.

The one I’m using was originally my dad’s, and based on what he remembers, it’s from the late 80s or early 90s.

But tbh, that feels like a small tradeoff for a machine that just won’t quit.\n\nIt’s built like a tank, easy to maintain, and makes excellent coffee. Definitely bifl purchase.

      "content": "Thermal mug with handle - something to keep the tea warm I keep forgetting about. Can I do better than Contigo? Preferably under 20EUR and a global brand (I'm from Poland and a lot of US stuff is not available here). I'm looking for a thermal mug with handle - something to keep my tea warm. Everything bigger than a double espresso I keep forgetting about and end up drinking it cold.\n\n* **STABILITY AND HANDLE**. Typical travel thermal mugs I keep knocking over and I don't want to damage my computer. It has to be stable and with a firm handle like a traditional mug.\n* **WARM:** something that's going to work better than those 5EUR chinese crappers that people keep selling with their logo for 30EUR. I bet you can tell what products I'm talking about. I don't expect the coffee to be scolding hot after 8 hours, but it would be nice if it didn't go back to the room temp after 2 hours or sth.\n* **EASY TO CLEAN:** I've seen some comments about certain mugs having over-designed lid and a guy got his mouldy from milk and sugar (it's in the reddit post mentioned below). I've had my own problems with some cheap, supermarket button ones in the past.\n* **PRICE REFLECTING THE QUALITY AND FUNCTIONALITY:** I bet you guys don't want to pay just for the logo. I think under 20EUR is reasonable for a mug, if there's something **really worth it** above that I'll be very happy to do research and thinking about it. \n\n**What I found on my own:**\n\n**Contigo -** the one from the main picture. The reviews on local go-to online store (allegro.pl) seem somewhat mixed - there's a lot of \"weirdly positive ones\" and few people commenting that it's not worth the price. I wonder if they are particularly picky or if the positive ones got greased.\n\nI have found another brand, I think it was **Camp Mug Stanley**, but it's more than twice the price of the Contigo and I'm not sure if the quality and warm-keeping is crazy good or it's just some English brand or sth.\n\nLore:\n\nI was browsing the thermal mugs and it's super hard to cut-through rebranded TEMU crap these days. I've found [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/1hgy4mr/leakproof_insulated_travel_mug_recommendations/) , and found some interesting companies recommended. However, the author of that post was looking for something for car travel and I'm looking for something that's exactly the opposite. I have a dozen of those travel mugs and they're decent for quick car coffee, but at my desk I keep knocking them over... Right now I have a cheap plastic one I bought specifically for reusable car coffee use - it's not bad, but it doesn't hold warmth at all.\n\nAt first I thought about buying a coffe maker that heats the pot, (my clumsy ass knocked over the last one during cleaning and the pot shattered). I used to make big pot of tea for the day and we'd drink it for hours. However it wasn't without downsides - we didn't use it outside of colder months and it was another useless space-taker. I've decided it's better to get more all-rounder thermal mugs. We already have a pair for cocoa, but they are the handle-less ones and I don't want to spill it onto my work station. They were cheap, so they are good to keep the drink warm up to \\~40 minutes tops.",

I was cleaning out my closet the other day and realized I still have the same pair of boots I bought almost 8 years ago. They’ve been through rain, snow, road trips, and even a move across the country, and somehow they’re still going strong. Just a little polish now and then and they look brand new.  \nIt got me thinking about how rare it is to actually buy something once and not have to replace it. Most of the stuff I use every day headphones, jackets, even kitchenware ends up breaking or wearing down.  \nFunny enough, I had that thought while I was waiting for a friend to log on, just absentmindedly browsing grizzly's quest. The boots popped into my head and I realized they’re probably the one thing I own that actually deserves the buy it for life label.  \nSo now I’m curious what’s the one item you own that’s lasted way longer than you expected?",

And even sitting in the back with the driving seat adjusted for my own comfort, there is no problem. Enough leg room. This vehicle in QWD version is excellent VFM. And it MOVES! The paddle shift regen controls are a joy, just like in my Hyundai Kona EV. The Frequency Selective Dampers and suspension tuning are phenomenal - an excellent, planted ride. Takes curves very well because of its lowered centre of gravity because the battery is nice and weighted below. One can drive it fearlessly across our Bangalore potholes and speed bumps considering its high ground clearance. It is a very good effort by Tata and I love its Discovery Sport inspired kind of aesthetics. To me, this vehicle is more appealing than the over designed Mahindra EV Twins. The two places it lacks as compared to my Hyundai Kona EV is under thigh support and lumbar support. We have to see how the servicing is. And the software updates and all that. The 75 KWH Battery and real life 528km range should easily take one from Bangalore to Ooty on one charge, via the Sigur Ghat. I think this may just be the right practical choice for touring too!",

Now Tata will face seriously competition from new Creta,Mg, Haval,citroen,new Jeep compass,xuv 500.\nIf Tata is considering few more upgrade then harrier will be non beatable in below 20 lakhs segment.\n1. Rear disc brakes\n2. 10 inch infortaintment system with 360 degree camera.\n3. Optional 4x4 system.\n4.paddel shifters.\n5. Internet connectivity.\n6. Standard black colour option.\n7.electric operated boot.\n8.19 inch alloys.\n9. GNCAP rating \n10. Automatic petrol engine.\n11. 5 year unlimited warranty ( even newbie Chinese company MG is giving 5 year road assistance and warranty)\n12.

Safari had accident when driving at 162 kmph at an Expressway in India had accident with a stray cattle. \nWhole family of 5 people were completely safe, not even a single scratch. Car didn't even roll ever, it's second stage braking was activated(automatically) right after accident. It was a head on collision. In body shop after inspection, I came to know over all frame structure of the car was well maintained, no deformation or even crack. After 2 months, same Safari was back on the road with new engine (as it was under warranty & end to end full insurance) , new radiator & other parts of the front end. \nTherefore, I don't say this car is efficient by engine power but the kind of price you pay, u get the real value of robustness & strong build quality.",

Despite raising complaints via email and Instagram, I only received copy-paste replies with no real solution. There is no responsible person from Tata who actually steps in to resolve anything. Don’t be fooled by official replies under comments , they are just for show. If you care about service, support, and long-term peace of mind, just avoid Tata.",

The same applies to the XEV 9E — the best features and performance are reserved for the top-spec variant, which is priced around ₹32L ex-showroom. I expect the top variant of the Harrier EV to fall in a similar price range.\n\nWhat I really liked about the XEV 9E is its semi-active suspension system. It adapts based on the selected drive mode, offering excellent ride comfort with minimal body roll. In contrast, when I drove the regular Harrier, I noticed considerable body roll and wasn’t impressed with the steering feedback.\n\nAlso, based on my experience, Mahindra’s after-sales service is better than Tata’s. While the Harrier EV may look impressive on paper, real-world performance and experience can differ. It’s definitely worth test-driving both vehicles before making a decision.",

Some people are talking about battery differences, and guy's it's just 4 Kwh, and it depends on the engine tuning, the range may vary.\n\nTata has been manufacturing EVs since 2019, and they have a good track record. Between Mahindra XUV 400 EV is a disaster. \n\nAbout the charging speeds! It's 5 minues difference, and 98% of the charging stations in India don't support 180 kw charging speeds. 50% are 24 - 30kw only remaining are below 120kw. Harrier has a UPI-based in-car payment system as well, which will be very useful.\n\nHarrier EV base variant and base + 1 variant has all the essential features and it offers 65 Kw batters not like Mahindra that offers only 59 Kw for the base and forces it's customers to buy the top-end variant!\n\nDriver drowsiness alert is also there in Harrier Ev from the base variant as a standard safety feature. XEV 9e adaptable suspension is only reserved for top variants whereas Harriers' new Independent multi-link rear suspension with frequency-dependent damping is available for all variants\n\nI'm booking Harrier Adventure S, which is a value for money variant that has a panoramic sun roof that actually opens!",

This can’t be corrected by software since they done mistake of having two options in single button on the key . For tall persons 6 inch and above this car will not fit them ugly to call this as suv it hits the dashboard. Tata service centre need to check how they are going mahindra has improved a lot even better features than this car check out mahindra xev9e outstanding  futuristic car any day than harrier .. but you need to shell out some extra over harrier as it looks also great 👍",

As a person who is 6feet 2 inches tall, when the driving seat is pushed back and at its low position, there is absolutely NO problem with Knee Room. And even sitting in the back with the driving seat adjusted for my own comfort, there is no problem. Enough leg room. The vehicle in QWD version is excellent VFM. And it MOVES! The paddle shift regen controls are a joy. The Frequency Selective Dampers and suspension tuning are phenomenal - an excellent, planted ride. Takes curves very well because of its lowered centre of gravity because the battery is nice and weighted below. I love its Discovery Sport inspired kind of aesthetics. To me, Harrier EV is more appealing than the over designed Mahindra EV Twins. The two places it lacks are under thigh support and lumbar support. We have to see how the servicing is. And the software updates and all that. The 75 KWH Battery and real life 528km range should easily take one touring long distance too!",

I may be wrong as I am no expert. \nAnd one or two so called influencers didn’t like my comment .\n\nAbout EVs in general.\nyou pay 2-3 L more than its petrol equivalent. You enjoy torque, speed, features. you have more or less range anxiety, Range anxiety is not only about vehicle's range. availability, functionality of the charging stations. The battery working reduces by 5-10% every year. after 5-7 years you decide to sell it, The battery loses it's capacity by 25-35%. Or new technology like solid state battery or NaCl battery comes a way cheaper in the new cars and you sell your car at a throwaway price say, 7-8 L cheaper than its petrol equivalent. Hope this changes in next 5 years.",

We're just waiting for the Sierra to come out and if it can match the space of the Safari, that might be the option to go for, otherwise it's right back to the Safari. They've gotten so much right with the car that it's hard to fault anything. I know people might prefer the XUV over this, but drive both back to back and I'll tell you, if you're looking for an overall package, the Safari is it.",

      "content": "Few points - Safari 2024 Acc+ AT owner here with over 11k now in over a year -\n1) 360 camera is best in segment - the main rival is XUV700 which is laggy and low res in comparison, speaking from experience. In Safari its slick, great details as well and works consistently, makes handling tight parking and even low speed maneuvers easy , try the brakes in 3D mode in the 360 interface and the car thumbail shows this as well. Great attention to detail.\n2) Safari doesn't have Lane Change Assist - this only comes in the new Mahindra EVs, no Tata car as of date has it.\n3) Safari Facelift didn't have LKA (Lane Keep Assist) on launch (Oct 2023), this came as a SW update in Nov/Dec 2024, prior to the update the LKA button would say what you're seeing \"this feature will be available shortly\" - so this is what you're seeing, once the SW is updated it works seamlessly, no niggles. It doesn't go wonky like you say it does and work/not work sometimes. It works as expected and advertised, period.\n4) SW bugs - the initial software 12.x was buggy, however since 14.x service and now on 15.x - the only bugs i see is the loud Blind Spot Alert sound which starts very loud and then falls into place and the sound duck where there is no voice readout/beep. Very rarely (seen it 3 times in 1+ year) the tpms throws some error which goes away on its own. 95 percent of the times it works without any niggles.\n5) When using paddle shifters, it goes into sport mode and that's the only mode it can be used in - if you dont use the paddles it'll revert back to the city mode, this is the standard behaviour. This is exactly what happened during the video as well when it gave the City mode readout, its normal.\n6) ADAS Features - Well tuned for indian conditions, hasn't given me any issues, behaviour is consistent and predictable. The AEB/FCW is a must have feature in every car as it'll slam the brakes ensuring one slows down considerably in the event of a collision and might fully prevent one as well.",

      "content": "Hard hitting fact, and I know many wont agree, but TATA cannot keep selling their car just based on vanity and patriotism. They need good Engineers. Still using an old Fiat engine. Harrier's chassis is borrowed from Old Landrover discovery, Engine from Fiat and Gearbox from Hyundai and yet even after combining them they  managed to make the whole engine-gearbox combo unreliable. \n\nI think Mahindra is doing a far far better job, again not perfect, and still a long way to go, but their Engineering is doing a better job. I test drove Thar Roxx one day, and was surprized to see how smooth and punchy that diesel engine was. Even the craftmanship on Mahindra car appears better than TATAs. \nCurvv for example is just a Nexon from inside. And the steering itself feels poorly made. Pressing on horn itself is so frustrating. \n\nAnd even on Curvv, TATA simply couldn't bring 1.5L Turbo petrol, so they brought 2 1.2L Turbos. seriously, and they are extracting around 1.5L more on just adding the GDI on their existing 1.2. And even on the features front they throw everything at you but most of them doesn't work. \nLED light bar, most of the time malfunctions. Even the lighting is uneven. \nTouch screen misfires occasionally \nThe sport mode, at least in Curvv which I test drove, I didn't felt any difference. \nSteering, vague, I think Hyundai group steering is far better than TATA now. \nPaddle shifters are just useless here, many times i tried downshifting, but all I got the message on Gear change denied. \n\nI am not trying to bash them irrationally, but they need to up their game. They need to innovate more.",

Should have had 4wd option + rear wheel driven to really give it the fortuner / scorpio feel. Plus service centers are poor , they have a general chalta hai attitude which is not suitable for today's day and age with so many options and high service orientation from companies.",

It's a pretty simple logic; but seems too hard for the folks who keep complaining about the lack of a RWD and 4x4 Safari. The cost of R&D, new assembly line as well as added complexity to the supply chain to convert the whole lineup or even add the RWD and 4x4 options probably doesn't add up. Would you do it if you were already making bank with FWD models? \n\nThe OG Safari and Hexa got axed because people weren't buying them. I'm not the target customer for RWD or 4x4 vehicles, but I'd have loved to own a Tata nano, especially an electric one. But no point in lamenting about the demise of a product once we collectively vote for its demise by not buying it, eh? \n\nWe don't get the products we want because we ourselves signal to the companies that we don't deserve them. It's kind of unrelated to this topic, but the monumentally stupid policies of our government (sub 4m mongrel automobiles, anyone?) and the eye-watering taxes aren't helping the cause either.",

This product has never aimed for those traits. And Safari moniker is too compelling to have been allowed to disappear in oblivion, which would have been the case if it would have been for those qualities. It's already 5th year since Storme was discontinued and looking at their future strategy at present, it would have taken at least 10 years, if at all, for reintroduction of a beast boasting that kind of prowess. I would say I'm sad they are not working on something like that than being disappointed with the use of that name on this car.",

It's a very refined product from Tata.\n\nFor the following cons, here are the solutions.\n1) Regarding gear noise for cold start - I always move from P to N first and then disengage the handbrake. For parking, I first put it on N, then engage the handbrake and then press N. I did not get this issue as you mentioned.\n2) Software issues - Initially I did face some glitches but after Software updates at Tata Service centre it was resolved.\n3) Glitches in Apple Car Play / Android Auto - I do get these disconnects, but I have observed that my phone gets hotter when using Apple Car Play. To cool my device, I keep my phone in the cooled area under the arm rest. This will ensure that device is cooler and disconnects don't happen. I did drive for almost 320kms at a stretch, but did not get this issue.\n4) Brakes are good, I do drive most of the times in the City and I have managed to stop the car because of some idiots appearing out of nowhere in the road.",

As it is, diesel vehicles become unusable in the NCR and elsewhere after 10 years, which sucks. So as long as my vehicle is not polluting, I should have the right to drive it. Right? \nLooking forward to some valuable inputs so I might finally buy the new Harrier.\nThank you.",
