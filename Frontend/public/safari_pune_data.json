Your friendly, emotionally bankrupt Punekar reporting live from the urban safari that is my daily commute.\n\nToday, I had the honor of encountering our city\u2019s most majestic species: **Pushpas on the road.**\n\nYou know them.\n\nTwo-wheeler riders with the phone wedged between their shoulder and ear.  \nOne hand on the accelerator, one hand on destiny, and a neck angle that would make chiropractors retire..\n\n**Flower. Not fire.**\n\nSaw two accidents today, the first accident starred a **Pushpa on a Bullet**\u2014no mirrors, no brain cells, and a neck angle that would impress yoga teachers. He was gliding along with his phone tucked flower-style, moving slower than a sugarcane tractor on paternity leave. Then a car behind him honked. That was it. Pushpa got triggered. \n\n**\u201cRukhega nai saala!\u201d**\n\nHe panicked, twisted the throttle like he was escaping the law of physics, and **bang!** Straight into the car in front. The impact was so poetic, even the potholes paused to watch.  \n  \nHe gets down, dusts himself off, and instead of apologizing, turns to the car behind him and yells:  \n**\u201cKai ghai aahe tujhi?!\u201d**\n\nSir WHAT?!?!?\u2026 YOU were on the phone. YOU crashed. But sure, let\u2019s blame the person who honked because you were holding a traffic conference call on a scooter and moving slower than a sugarcane tractor on strike. (Btw, is it just me or are we seeing a lot of tractors on the road, in the past couple of weeks?)\n\nThe second accident was at **Mundhwa Chowk,** which I call **the armpit of Pune.** The traffic is so humid and sticky, it feels like the city is trying to marinate you in your own sweat.\n\nHere, another Pushpa bloomed. Wrong-side overtaking, speed breaker as launchpad, phone still flower-style like he was hosting **Pushpa FM 101.1: Live from the ICU.**\n\nPhysics, like Pune Police, did not care.  \n  \nHe went airborne, landed mid-road, and two random guys helped him up. He casually brushed the dust off, restarted the bike, and rode away like this was his **daily cardio.** In Mundhwa, that\u2019s not an \u201caccident\u201d\u2014it\u2019s just **another petal on the asphalt.**\n\nI swear, Pune\u2019s roads have become **Pushpa Gardens**\u2014full of two-wheeler flowers blooming in chaos.  \n**Flower today. Bouquet at your funeral tomorrow.**",

Me and my wife wanted to celebrate that by traveling some place. So we are looking for suggestions where we could travel to from Pune while considering below things:\n\n1. We got a car and plan to travel via car only as it'll be more flexible,  easy and more manageable for my daughter and wife. So distance can't be more than 8-9hrs away.\n\n2. We don't want to have a party etc, just want a peaceful trip where 3 of us could relax amd enjoy this occasion.\n\n3. We are open to anything, temples, beaches, mountains(trekking is also fine), jungle safari, camping.\n\n4. Plan to keep it to a 2 day trip but can extend or shorten the trip if needed.\n\nAll suggestions are welcome. Thanks.",

Idk how to frame this or to post this i am just writing it, I'll cut the emotions and keep it rational, so I 18M have found myself along with my family of 4 in a very unfortunate situation, well soon to be 3 as docs losing hopes for my father. We are based in Pimpri-Chinchwad,  So at the dawn of last year my father[46] was diagnosed with Blood Cancer, specifically AML in Deenanath Mangeshkar Hospital. He was cancer-free after a few months as it was detected very early. We got his Bone Marrow Transplant [BMT] done, and his brother's match of bone marrow was only 70%, so to get that to 100% we had to do a procedure that was well over 25L. Post BMT he was getting back to normal even to his 9to5 job which he lived for. But again a few months back we saw a spike in WBCs and it was a mutation in AML, now last to last week we tried to give him a very high dose of chemo (FLAG and CLAG) which literally kills every possible thing, the doc also told us this could lead in a very bad as he also has a history of cardiac disease with 1 angioplasty done but we had literally no other option left everything was tried, everything. So one day into it, we landed in ICU terminating the chemotherapy of 5 days, getting diagnosed with pneumonia and infrants in the brain. \n\nHe is a financially sound man and had savings of around 50L. He has a good-paying job of ~50L PA. Which was brought down ~35L last year after his treatment was going on, he was still working and attending phone calls even after there was no need to, that's how much passion he has.\n\nWe have a home loan of idk how many years left but emi being ~25k, a 1700sqft in Pimpri-Chinchwad. A car loan, EMI of ~50k which was being paid by his company but he owns it, idk how he did but did that, the car is an XUV700 AXL. We fully own a Ciaz zxi driven 1.4L km. \n\nAbout his term insurance he has a 1.5Cr cover, idk if there are any savings left, he had ~20L invested in MF, me and my brothers'(M15) education policy of ~25L combined. We sold our paternal grandparent's house earlier this month(they passed away around 2018 both of them) which brought ~12L named after my father.\n\nMy father has two brothers both well-off based in Pune. My mother has two brothers both well-off based in Pimpri-Chinchwad. My maternal grandparents are well-off based in Dehu Road earlier in Kothrud.\n\nI am keeping my hopes high but also being prepared for the worst.

Just this afternoon in Pune, I was driving my scooter on a road, which is not crowded at all anytime otherwise, but today was full of traffic due to a local election. I had gone just one turn away from my house, and then I bumped into an Innova in front of me.. the Innova had also braked.I don't fully recall though if it was the driver's fault or mine, there was a little dent and scratch on the back plastic guard, and it was unusual bumper to bumper traffic ahead of us.\n\nDriver said he will call owner till then told me to wait. I told him I have to go somewhere, and that it's a minor thing, still I waited. When the owner came he said its too much of work, it is new vehicle etc (I looked it up online, the plastic part would be around 3-4k).\n\nThey checked my vehicle too, and found it dented, but I told him it was caused much earlier. All there was due to today's impact was a little white paint from the Innova plastic part. I had to give them my name, mobile, vehicle number, but I have the driver's number only, not the owner's.\n\nI asked the guy his name, and looked him up on fb, also checked his vehicle number on RTO site. Found that the guy is a wrestler and son of a local rural NCP politician..the types who flaunt their wealth.. and that the vehicle is registered in the father's name. \n\nIn the end I told him that I braked still it hit, I apologised many times and even told him I didn't do it purposely, had it been my fault I would have ran off right away, he said we will see..not that he threatened me in any way but I'm really tensed after discovering this info about him. Family knows nothing about this. What do you think can he do? And what should I do?",

        "content": "Minor road accident today, please advise. I've posted in r/pune too, but I need and will appreciate responses here too.. Just this afternoon in Pune, I was driving my scooter on a road, which is not crowded at all anytime otherwise, but today was full of traffic due to a local election. I had gone just one turn away from my house, and then I bumped into an Innova in front of me.. the Innova had also braked.I don't fully recall though if it was the driver's fault or mine, there was a little dent and scratch on the back plastic guard, and it was unusual bumper to bumper traffic ahead of us.\n\nDriver said he will call owner till then told me to wait. I told him I have to go somewhere, and that it's a minor thing, still I waited. When the owner came he said its too much of work, it is new vehicle etc (I looked it up online, the plastic part would be around 3-4k).\n\nThey checked my vehicle too, and found it dented, but I told him it was caused much earlier. All there was due to today's impact was a little white paint from the Innova plastic part. I had to give them my name, mobile, vehicle number, but I have the driver's number only, not the owner's.\n\nI asked the guy his name, and looked him up on fb, also checked his vehicle number on RTO site. Found that the guy is a wrestler and son of a local rural NCP politician..the types who flaunt their wealth.. and that the vehicle is registered in the father's name. \n\nIn the end I told him that I braked still it hit, I apologised many times and even told him I didn't do it purposely, had it been my fault I would have ran off right away, he said we will see..not that he threatened me in any way but I'm really tensed after discovering this info about him. Family knows nothing about this. What do you think can he do? And what should I do?",

        "content": "Health care infrastructure is collapsing all around us... Lost a known person to Covid-19 today in Pune. He had risen from very poor background and worked really hard to become a good father and husband. His wife is struggling in ICU with Spo2 of 60 and Doctors have given up on her and she can pass away any moment. His son and daughter were struggling to get remdesivir injection and oxygen but could get none. Despite being a well to do person with money to buy required medicines, he had to die a neglected death.\n\nDoctors are either overwhelmed or just dont care anymore. Nobody from patients family can go in, and one can only wonder how much care will be given to a patient inside overloaded hospitals.\n\nConditions are very very bad out there. I am unable to hold back my tears at the thought of the kids losing both their parents on the same day - unable to do anything. We middle class people cant even use our savings to buy injections and oxygen for the loved ones.\n\nThese two will become just another number in the long list of covid related deaths. Lives are getting destroyed but that will not be felt by the corrupt and careless politicians who wasted an entire year doing nothing. CMO Maharashtra is busy securing his child's future as a minister at the expense of state's population. why were the beds and health infra not bolstered during the year. Why didn't the highly educated IAS officers take care of upcoming remdesivir situation.\n\nIts the feeling of helplessness - not being able to do anything and just waiting for somebody to die. Why work hard, pay taxes, follow rules - when ultimately the system is going to betray us.\n\nIs it a common man's fate to die like this? .. This is not acceptable.. this whole system sucks...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: There is no political angle to this post. It is against the system which has failed us common people. BJP is also at fault for not ramping up oxygen, remdesivir production, shutting down hospitals etc. \n\nFrustration is because these people purchase new fortuners/innovas for all corporators, MLAs, MPs etc after every election - but dont have the basic decency of using tax payer money to beef up basic amenities for citizens. They get to go to AIIMS, foreign hospitals for their illnesses but we have to rot and die in the sh\\*thole they have left for us...",

        "content": "Almost ended up dying twice in 'ONE' day. Hey all. I love Pune but it is becoming very hard to still be in love with this wonderful city cause of a few reasons.\n\n  \n1. I was on the highway, and took the exit at Suncity Rd and a car was merging from the left but there was sufficient space for them to merge and for me to continue without stopping, so I continued and suddenly an Innova driver came up to my right and scraped my 2W bit, fortunately it touched the bodyguard and did not do any damage. I got a bit scared as if I had been a bit to the right, they would have easily dashed into me. I was in the left lane while they were in the right lane going in the same direction as me (totally wrong side). I honked at them and they did not even look back, then I saw them being busy chatting on their phone. I gave up and continued my journey.\n\n  \n2. While coming back home, on the Sinhgad Clg road, I was riding safely and all of a sudden a swift came at me from the left, luckily I had enough time (and space as no vehicle in the opposite lane and no-one behind me) to react and swerved to the right to avoid a collision. Once again, I checked what the driver is doing and saw they are busy chatting with their friends / relatives in the car. \n\n\n\n3, If you complain about them being wrong, get ready to get beaten up or something. At this point, I feel hopeless in the law & order as well as civic sense of this city.\n\n\n\n4. Auto drivers try their best to rip you off. If you use Uber, many times they will rant about how Uber takes some commission, but if you try going direct, they do not want to go unless you pay 2.5 times of the usual fare. \n\n  \n5. The roads are real bad with no real markings on speed-breakers. Kuthe sulta speedbreaker tar kadhi ulta !\n\n\n\nI have been to many cities, and yes, I am not going to say that this is something which only happens in Pune, but lately such incidents have been happening a lot. Many of my friends and relatives also complain to me about similar experiences. I find it somewhat of a relief when I drive / ride in other cities.\n\nI still love this city but we need to figure out the above. I really hope that we figure it out someday.\n\nEnd of rant. Thank you!",

Has anyone done a day trip like this? Apart from the fact that it\u2019s going to be tiring , are there anything\u2019s that I haven\u2019t considered?\n\nAdditionally what\u2019s the best route to take? Google Maps shows 2-3 different options but would like to know based on people\u2019s experience. Travel would be via a rented taxi like Innova\n\nThanks",
